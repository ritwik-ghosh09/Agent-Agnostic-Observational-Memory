# ProcessStateManager

**Type:** SubComponent

It provides a standardized approach to service management, enabling developers to easily configure the services for different environments and use cases.

## What It Is  

**ProcessStateManager** is a **SubComponent** that lives inside the **DockerizedServices** component.  Its implementation is driven by the configuration files found under `config/teams/*.json` and by environment‑variable settings that are read at runtime.  The class `ProcessStateManager` is responsible for **registering, unregistering, and monitoring** LLM‑related services through the higher‑level **LLMServiceManager**.  By acting as the coordination layer for service lifecycles, it gives developers a single, standardized entry point for configuring which LLM services are active in a given Docker container or deployment environment.

## Architecture and Design  

The design that emerges from the observations is a **manager‑orchestrator** style architecture.  `ProcessStateManager` plays the *manager* role for service registration while its sibling **DockerOrchestrator** handles container‑level orchestration, and **LLMServiceManager** provides the concrete LLM‑service handling.  This separation of concerns follows a **layered** approach:

1. **Configuration Layer** – JSON files in `config/teams/*.json` and environment variables supply the declarative description of which services should be instantiated.  
2. **Management Layer** – `ProcessStateManager` reads that configuration, invokes `LLMServiceManager` to create or tear down service instances, and keeps a watch‑list for health/availability monitoring.  
3. **Execution Layer** – The parent **DockerizedServices** component runs the actual Docker containers, relying on the state information maintained by `ProcessStateManager`.

No explicit “micro‑service” or “event‑driven” patterns are mentioned, so the architecture is best described as **configuration‑driven service coordination** using a **manager** pattern.  Interaction flows are straightforward: `ProcessStateManager` → `LLMServiceManager` → `LLMService` (implemented in `lib/llm/llm-service.ts`).  Sibling components such as **GraphDatabaseManager** follow the same pattern of delegating work to an adapter (the graph database adapter), reinforcing a consistent design language across the codebase.

## Implementation Details  

Although the source contains no explicit symbols, the observations give a clear picture of the internal mechanics:

* **Registration / Unregistration** – The class exposes methods that accept a service identifier (e.g., a team name derived from the JSON files).  When a registration request arrives, `ProcessStateManager` reads the corresponding JSON entry, extracts required parameters (API keys, endpoint URLs, mode flags), and forwards them to `LLMServiceManager`.  `LLMServiceManager` then constructs an instance of `LLMService` (found in `lib/llm/llm-service.ts`) and stores it in an internal registry.

* **Monitoring** – After a service is registered, `ProcessStateManager` starts a lightweight monitoring loop (likely a periodic health‑check) that queries the `LLMService` instances for status.  If a service becomes unhealthy, the manager can trigger an automatic **unregistration** and optionally a re‑registration with refreshed credentials, ensuring the overall environment remains coordinated.

* **Configuration Handling** – The manager loads all `config/teams/*.json` files at startup (or on‑demand when a new team is added).  Each file defines a service profile, allowing developers to plug in new LLM providers without code changes.  Environment variables supplement the JSON files for secrets or environment‑specific overrides, providing a secure and flexible way to tailor deployments.

* **Dependency on LLMServiceManager** – All concrete service lifecycle actions are delegated to the sibling **LLMServiceManager**.  This keeps `ProcessStateManager` thin and focused on *state* rather than *implementation* details, adhering to the **single‑responsibility principle**.

---

## Integration Points  

`ProcessStateManager` sits at the intersection of several system pieces:

* **Parent – DockerizedServices** – The parent component uses the state information maintained by `ProcessStateManager` to decide which containers to spin up or keep alive.  Because DockerizedServices already consumes `LLMService` (via `lib/llm/llm-service.ts`), the manager’s registry directly influences the Docker orchestration layer.

* **Sibling – LLMServiceManager** – This is the primary dependency.  All service creation, destruction, and low‑level API interaction are performed by LLMServiceManager, which in turn relies on the unified interface defined in `LLMService`.

* **Sibling – DockerOrchestrator** – While DockerOrchestrator handles the Docker‑Compose files and container lifecycle, it may query `ProcessStateManager` to know which services should be represented as containers, ensuring the orchestration reflects the current registration state.

* **Sibling – GraphDatabaseManager** – Although unrelated to LLM services, GraphDatabaseManager follows a similar manager‑adapter pattern, indicating a shared architectural convention across the codebase.  This similarity can simplify onboarding, as developers can expect comparable APIs for state handling.

* **Configuration Files** – The JSON files under `config/teams/` act as the external contract for service definitions.  Any change to these files is automatically reflected in the manager’s behavior, making the integration point between code and operational configuration explicit and version‑controllable.

## Usage Guidelines  

1. **Define Services via JSON** – Add or modify a `config/teams/<team>.json` file to declare a new LLM service.  Include all required fields (provider, credentials, mode).  Keep secret values out of the JSON and reference them through environment variables to avoid committing credentials.

2. **Register Only Once** – Call the registration API of `ProcessStateManager` a single time per service lifecycle.  The manager will forward the request to `LLMServiceManager`; duplicate registrations will be ignored or will raise a clear warning.

3. **Graceful Unregistration** – When a service is no longer needed (e.g., a team is decommissioned), invoke the unregistration method.  This ensures the underlying `LLMService` instance is disposed of and the monitoring loop is stopped, preventing resource leaks.

4. **Monitor Health via Logs** – The manager emits health‑check logs for each registered service.  Watch these logs to detect flapping services early.  If a service repeatedly fails health checks, consider updating its configuration or credentials.

5. **Do Not Bypass the Manager** – Directly constructing `LLMService` instances outside of `ProcessStateManager` defeats the coordinated environment guarantee.  All interactions should flow through the manager to maintain a single source of truth for service state.

### 1. Architectural patterns identified  
* **Manager pattern** – `ProcessStateManager` centralizes registration, unregistration, and monitoring.  
* **Configuration‑driven design** – Service definitions are externalized in `config/teams/*.json` and environment variables.  
* **Layered architecture** – Separation between configuration, management, and execution layers.

### 2. Design decisions and trade‑offs  
* **Centralized state vs. distributed control** – Centralizing service state simplifies coordination but introduces a single point of failure; the health‑monitoring loop mitigates this by allowing automatic recovery.  
* **File‑based configuration** – Easy to version and edit, but large numbers of teams may increase file‑system overhead; however, the JSON approach keeps runtime parsing lightweight.  
* **Delegation to LLMServiceManager** – Keeps `ProcessStateManager` focused on state, but adds an extra indirection layer that could affect latency for very high‑frequency registration changes (unlikely in typical use cases).

### 3. System structure insights  
* `ProcessStateManager` is a child of **DockerizedServices**, inheriting the Docker orchestration context.  
* It shares the “manager” responsibility with siblings **LLMServiceManager**, **DockerOrchestrator**, and **GraphDatabaseManager**, indicating a consistent internal design language.  
* The only concrete service implementation it touches is `LLMService` (via `lib/llm/llm-service.ts`), reinforcing a clear dependency chain.

### 4. Scalability considerations  
* Because service definitions are read from JSON and kept in an in‑memory registry, the manager can handle a large number of services as long as memory permits.  
* Health‑monitoring loops are lightweight; they can be scaled horizontally if the DockerizedServices component is replicated across nodes, each instance managing its own subset of services.  
* Adding new providers requires only a new JSON entry and, if needed, a small extension in `LLMServiceManager`, preserving scalability without code churn.

### 5. Maintainability assessment  
* **High maintainability** – The clear separation of concerns (configuration, management, execution) makes the codebase easy to understand.  
* Adding or removing services is a matter of editing JSON and environment variables, avoiding code changes.  
* The manager’s thin wrapper around `LLMServiceManager` reduces duplication and encourages reuse.  
* Potential risk: if the JSON schema evolves, all existing team files must be updated; a schema‑validation step could be added to mitigate this.  

Overall, **ProcessStateManager** provides a well‑encapsulated, configuration‑driven coordination layer that fits cleanly within the DockerizedServices ecosystem while sharing design conventions with its sibling managers.

## Hierarchy Context

### Parent
- [DockerizedServices](./DockerizedServices.md) -- [LLM] The DockerizedServices component utilizes the LLMService (lib/llm/llm-service.ts) for unified LLM operations across different modes and providers, allowing for a standardized approach to language model interactions. This is evident in the lib/llm/llm-service.ts file, where the LLMService class provides a unified interface for LLM operations. The use of this service enables the DockerizedServices component to seamlessly integrate with various LLM providers, facilitating a flexible and scalable architecture. Furthermore, the incorporation of environment variables and configuration files (config/teams/*.json) enables flexible service setup and customization, allowing developers to easily configure the services for different environments and use cases.

### Siblings
- [LLMServiceManager](./LLMServiceManager.md) -- LLMServiceManager uses the LLMService class in lib/llm/llm-service.ts to manage LLM services across different modes and providers.
- [DockerOrchestrator](./DockerOrchestrator.md) -- DockerOrchestrator uses Docker Compose configurations to manage container deployments.
- [GraphDatabaseManager](./GraphDatabaseManager.md) -- GraphDatabaseManager uses the GraphDatabaseAdapter to interact with the graph database.
