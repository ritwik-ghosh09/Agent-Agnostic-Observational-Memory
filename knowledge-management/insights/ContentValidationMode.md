# ContentValidationMode

**Type:** Detail

The presence of 'constraint-configuration.md' and 'semantic-constraint-detection.md' in the project documentation suggests that the ContentValidationAgent's modes are configurable and tailored for specific use cases, further emphasizing the significance of ContentValidationMode.

## What It Is  

`ContentValidationMode` is the enumerated or configurable set of behaviours that drives how the **ContentValidationAgent** validates incoming content and produces validation reports. The only concrete references to this concept live in the documentation under `integrations/mcp-constraint-monitor/docs/semantic-constraint-detection.md` and the companion `constraint-configuration.md`. Both files stress that the agent can operate in **multiple validation modes**, each tuned for a particular use‑case (e.g., strict schema enforcement, relaxed semantic checks, or performance‑oriented quick scans). Because the documentation is the sole source of truth, we understand `ContentValidationMode` as a *configuration artifact* that the agent reads at start‑up and that subsequently governs the validation pipeline it executes.

The parent component, **ContentValidationAgent**, is described as “using various modes to validate content and provide validation reports.” This phrasing makes clear that the mode is not a peripheral flag but a core driver of the agent’s runtime behaviour. No source‑code symbols were discovered, which means the actual implementation (whether an enum, class hierarchy, or external configuration file) is abstracted away from the public repository and is likely defined in a language‑specific module that the documentation assumes developers will already be familiar with.

In practice, a developer or operator selects a `ContentValidationMode` by editing the constraint configuration files referenced in the docs. The mode selection is therefore *declarative*—the agent reads the configuration, instantiates the appropriate validation logic, and proceeds without further code changes. This aligns with the project’s emphasis on configurability and reuse across different deployment scenarios.

## Architecture and Design  

The documentation points to a **configuration‑driven architecture**. The presence of `semantic-constraint-detection.md` and `constraint-configuration.md` indicates that the system separates *policy* (the mode) from *mechanism* (the validation engine). The **ContentValidationAgent** acts as a façade that interprets the selected `ContentValidationMode` and delegates to the underlying validation components. This separation is a classic **Strategy pattern**: each mode encapsulates a distinct validation strategy (e.g., deep semantic analysis vs. shallow syntactic checks) while the agent remains agnostic to the specifics of each strategy.

Because the mode is defined outside of code, the design also leverages a **Configuration‑as‑Code** approach. The configuration files serve as the single source of truth for which validation strategy the agent should employ, enabling operators to switch modes without recompiling or redeploying binaries. This design promotes **operational flexibility** and aligns with the documentation’s emphasis on “tailored for specific use cases.”

Interaction between components is straightforward: the **ContentValidationAgent** reads the mode from the configuration at initialization, resolves the corresponding validation implementation (likely via a factory or service locator hidden behind the documentation), and then processes content through that implementation. The agent’s output—a validation report—is produced uniformly regardless of the selected mode, suggesting a **Template Method** style where the high‑level workflow is fixed while the mode‑specific steps are plugged in.

No explicit code paths are provided, so we cannot point to concrete class names or method signatures. However, the architectural intent is evident from the documentation: the system is built to be **extensible** (new modes can be added by extending the configuration schema) and **decoupled** (the agent does not need to know the inner workings of each mode).

## Implementation Details  

The only concrete artefacts we can reference are the two markdown files:

* `integrations/mcp-constraint-monitor/docs/semantic-constraint-detection.md` – describes the purpose of validation modes and how they affect the detection of semantic constraints.
* `integrations/mcp-constraint-monitor/docs/constraint-configuration.md` – outlines the configuration format that specifies which `ContentValidationMode` the **ContentValidationAgent** should run.

From these, we infer the following implementation scaffolding:

1. **Configuration Schema** – The `constraint-configuration.md` likely defines a YAML/JSON schema where a key such as `validationMode` accepts predefined string values (e.g., `STRICT`, `RELAXED`, `FAST`). This schema is parsed at agent start‑up.

2. **Mode Resolver** – Internally, the agent probably contains a resolver component that maps the configuration value to a concrete implementation class. This could be a simple `switch` statement, a registration map, or a dependency‑injection container.

3. **Validation Strategies** – Each mode corresponds to a distinct validation strategy. For example, a “STRICT” mode might invoke a full semantic model builder, whereas a “FAST” mode could bypass expensive graph traversals. The strategies share a common interface (e.g., `validate(content) -> ValidationResult`) so the agent can invoke them uniformly.

4. **Reporting Layer** – Regardless of the mode, the agent emits a validation report. The report format is likely standardized (JSON, protobuf, etc.) and defined elsewhere in the project. The mode influences the *content* of the report (e.g., number of diagnostics, severity levels) but not its shape.

Because no source code symbols were discovered, we cannot name the exact classes or functions. The design is nevertheless clear: the **ContentValidationAgent** is a thin orchestration layer that reads configuration, resolves a strategy, runs validation, and returns a report.

## Integration Points  

`ContentValidationMode` sits at the intersection of three system concerns:

1. **Configuration Management** – The mode is supplied via the files described in `constraint-configuration.md`. Any tooling that generates or validates these configuration files directly influences which mode the agent runs.

2. **Constraint Detection Subsystem** – As referenced in `semantic-constraint-detection.md`, the chosen mode determines how the **ContentValidationAgent** interacts with the constraint detection logic. For instance, a mode that enables deep semantic checks will trigger additional analysis passes in the constraint detection pipeline.

3. **Reporting Consumers** – Down‑stream services that consume the validation reports (e.g., CI pipelines, monitoring dashboards) rely on a stable report contract. While they do not interact with `ContentValidationMode` directly, they must be aware that different modes may produce varying levels of detail.

External components that need to influence validation behaviour should do so by editing the configuration files, not by calling internal APIs. This keeps the integration surface simple: a file‑based contract rather than a code‑level API. If future extensions require programmatic mode selection (e.g., via a REST endpoint), they would likely wrap the same configuration‑resolution logic used at start‑up.

## Usage Guidelines  

1. **Select the Appropriate Mode Early** – Because the mode is read at agent initialization, change it only when you can afford a restart of the **ContentValidationAgent**. Switching modes on a running instance is not supported by the current design.

2. **Align Mode with Use‑Case** – Use a strict mode when compliance and correctness are paramount (e.g., production releases). Opt for a relaxed or fast mode during rapid development or when processing large volumes of content where performance outweighs exhaustive checking.

3. **Maintain Configuration Consistency** – Keep the `constraint-configuration.md` file version‑controlled and validated against the schema described in the documentation. Inconsistent or misspelled mode values will cause the agent to fall back to a default (if one exists) or fail to start.

4. **Monitor Report Granularity** – Expect that stricter modes will generate more diagnostics, potentially increasing downstream processing load. Adjust downstream alerting thresholds accordingly.

5. **Extend with Caution** – Adding a new `ContentValidationMode` requires updating the configuration schema, the mode resolver, and implementing the corresponding validation strategy. Follow the existing pattern of separating configuration from implementation to preserve the system’s extensibility.

### Architectural Patterns Identified
* **Strategy (Mode‑Based Validation)** – Different validation behaviours encapsulated behind a common interface.
* **Configuration‑as‑Code** – Modes are selected via declarative configuration files.
* **Template Method (Fixed Workflow, Pluggable Steps)** – The agent’s overall validation flow remains constant while mode‑specific steps vary.

### Design Decisions and Trade‑offs
* **Declarative Mode Selection** – Enables rapid operational changes without code deployment, at the cost of requiring a restart to apply new modes.
* **Single‑Source Configuration** – Centralizes mode control, simplifying governance, but creates a single point of failure if the configuration is malformed.
* **Extensibility vs. Complexity** – Adding new modes is straightforward (add config entry + strategy class) but may increase the maintenance burden of the resolver and documentation.

### System Structure Insights
* **ContentValidationAgent** is the orchestrator; **ContentValidationMode** is a configuration‑driven plug‑in point that determines which validation strategy the agent employs.
* The mode influences the **semantic‑constraint‑detection** subsystem, shaping the depth and breadth of analysis.
* Validation reports are emitted uniformly, ensuring downstream consumers remain decoupled from mode specifics.

### Scalability Considerations
* **Performance Impact** – Modes that perform deep semantic analysis will consume more CPU and memory; selecting a lighter mode for high‑throughput scenarios mitigates this.
* **Horizontal Scaling** – Since mode selection is static per agent instance, scaling out by adding more agents does not require coordination beyond ensuring each instance uses the same configuration file (or a consistent distributed config store).

### Maintainability Assessment
* **High Maintainability** – The clear separation of configuration and implementation, combined with documented mode semantics, makes the system easy to understand and modify.
* **Documentation Dependency** – The lack of visible source‑code symbols places extra importance on keeping the markdown files accurate and up‑to‑date; any drift between docs and code could lead to misconfiguration.
* **Extensibility Path** – Adding or deprecating modes follows a predictable pattern (update config schema, add/remove strategy), supporting long‑term evolution without large refactors.
