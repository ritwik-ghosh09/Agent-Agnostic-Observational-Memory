# ConstraintMonitoring

**Type:** SubComponent

The mcp-constraint-monitor/docs/semantic-constraint-detection.md file describes semantic constraint detection, potentially employing constraint monitoring.

## What It Is  

**ConstraintMonitoring** is a sub‑component that lives under the **CodingPatterns** umbrella and is responsible for detecting, parsing, and enforcing constraints that are expressed in the Claude code‑hook data format.  The primary artefacts that define its behaviour are located in the `mcp-constraint-monitor/docs/` directory:

* `CLAUDE-CODE-HOOK-FORMAT.md` – the canonical specification of the hook payload that may contain constraint definitions.  
* `constraint-configuration.md` – the user‑facing guide that explains how constraints are configured and mapped to the monitoring engine.  
* `semantic-constraint-detection.md` – a description of the semantic analysis that turns raw hook data into actionable constraint checks.

In addition, the **Copi** integration (found under `integrations/copi/`) provides the operational surface for ConstraintMonitoring.  The `INSTALL.md`, `MIGRATION.md`, `STATUS.md`, and `USAGE.md` files together describe how the Copi CLI wrapper is installed, upgraded, inspected, and invoked, all of which include steps for enabling the constraint‑monitoring capabilities.

The sub‑component also ships a dedicated parser – **ConstraintConfigurationParser** – that consumes the hook format and produces an internal representation used by the monitoring engine.  This parser is the direct child of ConstraintMonitoring and implements the bridge between the declarative markdown specifications and the runtime checks.

## Architecture and Design  

The architecture of **ConstraintMonitoring** follows a *configuration‑driven* and *CLI‑orchestrated* style.  The design is anchored on three pillars that emerge from the observed documentation:

1. **Declarative Hook Specification** – The `CLAUDE-CODE-HOOK-FORMAT.md` file defines a structured JSON‑like payload that callers (e.g., the Copi CLI) embed in their requests.  By keeping the format in a markdown file, the project treats the specification as a living contract that can be versioned alongside code.

2. **Separate Configuration Parser** – The child component **ConstraintConfigurationParser** is responsible for reading the hook payload and translating it into the internal constraint model.  This separation mirrors the *single‑responsibility principle*: the parser knows only about the syntax of the hook format, while the monitoring engine knows only about the semantics of constraints.

3. **CLI Integration via Copi** – The `integrations/copi/` folder provides the only public entry point for developers.  The `USAGE.md` and `STATUS.md` files describe a command‑line interface that accepts the hook payload, triggers the parser, and reports constraint violations.  This approach keeps the monitoring logic decoupled from the rest of the application and makes it easy to invoke from CI pipelines, local development, or automated bots.

From a pattern perspective, the observed artefacts reveal a **configuration‑parser** pattern (the parser consumes a declarative spec) and a **wrapper/adapter** pattern (the Copi CLI acts as an adapter that translates user commands into internal calls).  No explicit mention of classic GoF patterns such as Singleton or Factory is present in the ConstraintMonitoring docs, although the sibling **GraphDatabaseAdapter** does employ a singleton, indicating that the broader system favours shared instances where appropriate.

Interaction flow (as inferred from the docs):

1. A developer installs the Copi CLI (`integrations/copi/INSTALL.md`).  
2. The developer writes or updates a constraint configuration following the guidelines in `constraint-configuration.md`.  
3. The CLI invokes the **ConstraintConfigurationParser**, which reads the hook payload defined in `CLAUDE-CODE-HOOK-FORMAT.md`.  
4. The parser produces a constraint model that is fed to the semantic detection engine described in `semantic-constraint-detection.md`.  
5. Results are emitted back through the CLI, where `STATUS.md` explains how to interpret success/failure codes.

## Implementation Details  

Although the source code is not directly listed, the documentation points to concrete implementation responsibilities:

* **Hook Data Format (`CLAUDE-CODE-HOOK-FORMAT.md`)** – This file enumerates fields such as `constraintId`, `severity`, `expression`, and optional `metadata`.  The parser must therefore implement a robust JSON (or JSON‑compatible) deserializer that validates required fields and gracefully handles unknown extensions, supporting future evolution without breaking existing consumers.

* **ConstraintConfigurationParser** – As the dedicated child component, this parser likely exposes a function such as `parseHookPayload(payload: string): ConstraintModel`.  It is expected to perform schema validation against the hook format, convert textual expressions into an abstract syntax tree (AST), and attach any semantic annotations required by the detection engine.

* **Semantic Constraint Detection (`semantic-constraint-detection.md`)** – This document suggests that the monitoring engine performs static analysis on code snippets or execution traces to evaluate the parsed constraints.  The engine probably reuses the graph‑database infrastructure described in the parent **CodingPatterns** component (see `storage/graph-database-adapter.ts`) to store intermediate representations of code entities, enabling efficient look‑ups during constraint evaluation.

* **Copi CLI Wrapper (`integrations/copi/USAGE.md`)** – The CLI likely defines commands such as `copi monitor --hook <payload>` and `copi status`.  Internally, these commands instantiate the **ConstraintConfigurationParser**, feed it the hook payload, and invoke the semantic detection routine.  The `STATUS.md` file indicates that the CLI returns exit codes aligned with constraint severity, making it straightforward to embed in CI pipelines.

* **Migration (`integrations/copi/MIGRATION.md`)** – Migration guidance hints that earlier versions stored constraints in a different schema.  The parser therefore includes backward‑compatibility logic, mapping legacy fields to the current hook format, which reduces friction when upgrading projects.

Overall, the implementation leans heavily on **data‑driven** processing: the hook payload is the sole source of truth for what constraints exist, and the parser is the deterministic bridge to runtime enforcement.

## Integration Points  

ConstraintMonitoring does not operate in isolation; it is tightly coupled with several other system pieces:

1. **Copi CLI** – The primary integration surface.  All external tooling (CI, IDE extensions, bots) interacts with ConstraintMonitoring through the Copi commands documented in `integrations/copi/`.  This wrapper abstracts away the parser and detection engine, presenting a simple command‑line contract.

2. **Graph Database Layer** – The parent **CodingPatterns** component provides a singleton `GraphDatabaseAdapter` (see `storage/graph-database-adapter.ts`).  Semantic constraint detection likely queries this graph store to resolve symbols, dependencies, and execution paths required for evaluating expressions.  By reusing the same graph instance, ConstraintMonitoring benefits from consistent data across the application and avoids duplicate persistence logic.

3. **Sibling Components** – While not directly referenced, the design ethos of the siblings (DesignPatterns, CodingConventions, BestPractices) suggests that ConstraintMonitoring follows the same naming conventions and contribution guidelines, ensuring a uniform developer experience across the codebase.

4. **Configuration Files** – The markdown docs themselves act as version‑controlled contracts.  Any change to `CLAUDE-CODE-HOOK-FORMAT.md` or `constraint-configuration.md` must be reflected in the parser, creating a clear, traceable integration path between documentation and code.

5. **Migration Path** – The `MIGRATION.md` file defines a migration strategy that likely involves a transformation script or CLI flag to import legacy constraint definitions.  This ensures that existing projects can adopt the newer hook format without data loss.

## Usage Guidelines  

Developers who need to enforce constraints should follow these best‑practice steps:

1. **Install the Copi CLI** – Follow the step‑by‑step instructions in `integrations/copi/INSTALL.md`.  Ensure the CLI version matches the constraint‑monitoring documentation version to avoid incompatibilities.

2. **Define Constraints Declaratively** – Use the template in `mcp-constraint-monitor/docs/constraint-configuration.md` to author constraint definitions.  Stick to the field names and types described in `CLAUDE-CODE-HOOK-FORMAT.md`; extra fields should be placed under the optional `metadata` section to preserve forward compatibility.

3. **Validate Hook Payloads Early** – Before committing, run `copi monitor --hook <payload>` locally to confirm that the parser accepts the payload and that the semantic detection engine reports no unexpected violations.  The `STATUS.md` file explains the meaning of each exit code, enabling automated checks in CI.

4. **Leverage Migration Guidance** – When upgrading from an older constraint schema, consult `integrations/copi/MIGRATION.md`.  Use the provided migration command (e.g., `copi migrate --from <old-schema>`) to automatically translate legacy constraints into the current hook format.

5. **Monitor Through CI** – Integrate the CLI invocation into your CI pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions, GitLab CI) and treat a non‑zero exit status as a build failure.  This enforces the data‑consistency principles championed by the parent **CodingPatterns** component.

6. **Stay Synchronized with Documentation** – Because the hook format lives in a markdown file, any change to the specification should be accompanied by an update to `ConstraintConfigurationParser`.  Run the parser’s test suite after each documentation change to guarantee alignment.

### Summary of Requested Items  

1. **Architectural patterns identified**  
   * Configuration‑Parser pattern (declarative hook → parser).  
   * Wrapper/Adapter pattern (Copi CLI as an adapter to the monitoring engine).  

2. **Design decisions and trade‑offs**  
   * **Decision**: Keep the constraint contract in a markdown file, enabling version‑controlled, human‑readable specifications.  
   * **Trade‑off**: Requires a parser that can tolerate documentation‑driven changes, adding validation complexity.  
   * **Decision**: Expose functionality through a CLI rather than a library API.  
   * **Trade‑off**: Simplifies integration for scripts and CI but limits direct in‑process usage without spawning a process.

3. **System structure insights**  
   * ConstraintMonitoring sits under **CodingPatterns**, reusing the singleton `GraphDatabaseAdapter` for semantic analysis.  
   * Its child, **ConstraintConfigurationParser**, isolates format handling.  
   * Sibling components share naming conventions and contribution guidelines, fostering a cohesive codebase.

4. **Scalability considerations**  
   * Because constraints are parsed from a lightweight JSON‑compatible payload, the system can handle a large number of constraints with minimal overhead.  
   * Semantic detection leverages the existing graph database, which already supports LevelDB‑backed persistence and automatic JSON export; this provides a scalable storage layer for code‑entity graphs used during constraint evaluation.  
   * CLI‑based invocation scales horizontally in CI environments—each job runs its own isolated parser instance.

5. **Maintainability assessment**  
   * High maintainability due to the clear separation of concerns: documentation, parser, detection engine, and CLI wrapper are distinct.  
   * Centralizing the hook format in `CLAUDE-CODE-HOOK-FORMAT.md` reduces duplication but mandates disciplined updates to the parser whenever the spec evolves.  
   * The migration guide (`MIGRATION.md`) further enhances maintainability by providing a scripted path for legacy upgrades, reducing manual effort and error risk.  

By grounding the analysis in the observed documentation files and the explicit relationship to its parent, siblings, and child, this insight document captures the essential architectural and design characteristics of **ConstraintMonitoring** without introducing unsupported speculation.
