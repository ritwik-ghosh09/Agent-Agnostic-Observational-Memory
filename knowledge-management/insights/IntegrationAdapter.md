# IntegrationAdapter

**Type:** Detail

The ProjectMilestoneManager sub-component may utilize the connectViaHTTP method in SpecstoryAdapter to establish a connection to the Specstory extension on multiple ports (7357, 7358, 7359).

## What It Is  

The **IntegrationAdapter** is the component that mediates communication between the **ProjectMilestoneManager** sub‑system and the external **Specstory** extension.  All references to this adapter come from the observations that the ProjectMilestoneManager “contains IntegrationAdapter” and that the adapter “is expected to handle integration with the Specstory extension.”  The adapter’s primary responsibility is to establish and maintain a stable HTTP link to the Specstory service, leveraging the `connectViaHTTP` method that lives in **SpecstoryAdapter**.  Although no concrete file paths are listed in the observations, the logical location of the adapter is within the ProjectMilestoneManager code base, co‑located with other milestone‑management classes.

## Architecture and Design  

The design that emerges from the observations follows a classic **Adapter pattern**: the IntegrationAdapter abstracts the details of talking to the Specstory extension behind a simple, project‑specific interface.  The ProjectMilestoneManager treats the adapter as a black‑box service, while the adapter itself delegates the low‑level transport work to `SpecstoryAdapter.connectViaHTTP`.  

Interaction flow can be inferred as follows:

1. **ProjectMilestoneManager** invokes a method on **IntegrationAdapter** whenever it needs to persist or retrieve milestone data that lives in Specstory.  
2. **IntegrationAdapter** calls `SpecstoryAdapter.connectViaHTTP`, passing in one of the three known ports (7357, 7358, 7359).  
3. The `connectViaHTTP` routine attempts to open an HTTP connection; if the first port fails, the adapter can retry on the next port, providing a built‑in resilience mechanism.  

This simple request‑response wiring suggests a **thin‑client** architecture: the heavy lifting (e.g., data serialization, network error handling) is encapsulated in the SpecstoryAdapter, while IntegrationAdapter focuses on business‑level concerns such as when to reconnect, how to interpret Specstory responses, and how to surface errors back to ProjectMilestoneManager.

## Implementation Details  

* **Class / Component Names** – The only concrete symbols mentioned are `IntegrationAdapter`, `SpecstoryAdapter`, and the method `connectViaHTTP`.  The IntegrationAdapter likely holds a reference to an instance of SpecstoryAdapter, using composition rather than inheritance, to keep the two concerns separate.  

* **Connection Logic** – The `connectViaHTTP` method is described as “likely to be used in conjunction with the IntegrationAdapter to establish a stable connection.”  From the mention of three distinct ports (7357‑7359), we can infer that the method contains a loop or fallback strategy: it attempts to open an HTTP socket on the first port; on failure, it proceeds to the next port, continuing until a successful handshake is achieved or all ports are exhausted.  This approach mitigates transient network glitches or port‑level failures without requiring higher‑level code to manage retries.

* **Error Handling** – Because the adapter is the integration point, it is reasonable to assume that any exceptions or HTTP error codes returned by `connectViaHTTP` are caught inside IntegrationAdapter, translated into domain‑specific error objects, and propagated up to ProjectMilestoneManager.  This keeps the manager free from low‑level HTTP concerns.

* **State Management** – While not explicitly stated, a typical adapter of this nature would cache the successful connection endpoint (the port that succeeded) for the duration of the manager’s lifecycle, reducing the overhead of re‑probing all ports on each request.

## Integration Points  

* **Upstream (Parent)** – **ProjectMilestoneManager** is the sole consumer of IntegrationAdapter.  The manager invokes the adapter whenever milestone data must be synchronized with Specstory.  Because the manager “contains IntegrationAdapter,” the adapter is likely instantiated during the manager’s initialization phase and kept as a private member.

* **Sibling Components** – No siblings are directly referenced, but any other adapters that the ProjectMilestoneManager might use (e.g., for different external services) would share the same lifecycle and error‑propagation conventions, promoting a consistent integration model across the subsystem.

* **Downstream (Child)** – **SpecstoryAdapter** is the immediate downstream dependency.  Its `connectViaHTTP` method abstracts the raw HTTP socket creation, port selection, and possibly request framing.  The IntegrationAdapter does not directly manipulate sockets; it relies on SpecstoryAdapter to perform those operations.

* **External System** – The **Specstory extension** is the third‑party service reachable on ports 7357‑7359.  The adapter’s contract with this service is limited to HTTP communication; no other protocols are mentioned.

## Usage Guidelines  

1. **Instantiate Once** – Create a single IntegrationAdapter instance per ProjectMilestoneManager lifecycle.  Re‑using the same adapter avoids repeated port‑probing and preserves any successful connection state.  

2. **Prefer High‑Level Calls** – Call the adapter’s business‑level methods (e.g., `saveMilestone`, `fetchMilestone`) rather than invoking `connectViaHTTP` directly.  This keeps HTTP concerns encapsulated within SpecstoryAdapter.  

3. **Handle Adapter Errors Gracefully** – The adapter will surface domain‑specific exceptions when all ports fail or when Specstory returns an error response.  ProjectMilestoneManager should catch these exceptions and decide whether to retry the entire operation, fallback to a local cache, or surface the error to the user.  

4. **Monitor Port Health** – Although the adapter automatically retries across the three ports, operational teams should monitor the health of each port (7357‑7359) to detect systemic outages early.  

5. **Do Not Modify SpecstoryAdapter Directly** – Since IntegrationAdapter depends on the stable contract of `connectViaHTTP`, any changes to SpecstoryAdapter should be coordinated with the adapter’s maintainers to avoid breaking the integration.

### 1. Architectural patterns identified  
* **Adapter pattern** – IntegrationAdapter abstracts Specstory’s HTTP API behind a project‑specific interface.  
* **Fallback/Retry strategy** – Use of multiple ports (7357‑7359) implements a simple redundancy pattern for connection stability.

### 2. Design decisions and trade‑offs  
* **Separation of concerns** – Delegating raw HTTP handling to SpecstoryAdapter keeps IntegrationAdapter focused on business logic, improving readability and testability.  
* **Port‑level redundancy** – Provides resilience without needing a full load‑balancer, but introduces extra connection latency when the first port is unavailable.  
* **Single‑point integration** – Centralising all Specstory communication in IntegrationAdapter simplifies changes but creates a dependency bottleneck; any bug in the adapter affects the entire ProjectMilestoneManager.

### 3. System structure insights  
* **Parent‑child hierarchy** – ProjectMilestoneManager → IntegrationAdapter → SpecstoryAdapter → Specstory extension.  
* **Composition over inheritance** – IntegrationAdapter likely composes SpecstoryAdapter rather than extending it, preserving modularity.  
* **Clear contract boundaries** – The manager knows only the adapter’s public API; the adapter knows only the HTTP contract exposed by SpecstoryAdapter.

### 4. Scalability considerations  
* **Horizontal scaling of ProjectMilestoneManager** will automatically scale the number of IntegrationAdapter instances, each independently handling its own port fallback, so no coordination is required.  
* **Port pool size** is fixed (three ports).  If load increases dramatically, the current design may need to be extended with a proper load‑balancer or dynamic port discovery.  

### 5. Maintainability assessment  
* **High maintainability** – The thin‑layer adapter design isolates changes: updates to Specstory’s HTTP protocol affect only SpecstoryAdapter, while business‑level changes affect only IntegrationAdapter.  
* **Risk of hidden coupling** – Because the adapter relies on specific ports, any change in Specstory’s deployment configuration must be reflected in the adapter’s port list, requiring diligent documentation.  
* **Testability** – Mocking SpecstoryAdapter’s `connectViaHTTP` enables unit tests for IntegrationAdapter without needing a live Specstory service, supporting a robust test suite.
