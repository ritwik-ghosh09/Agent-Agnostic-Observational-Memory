# OntologyIntegration

**Type:** SubComponent

The integration of the Ontology system with the CodingPatterns component allows for automatic JSON export sync, ensuring that data is consistently up-to-date and readily available for use within the component.

## What It Is  

**OntologyIntegration** is a sub‑component that lives inside the **CodingPatterns** domain. Its implementation is spread across a handful of concrete artefacts, the most visible of which is the use of the **GraphDatabaseAdapter** located at `storage/graph-database-adapter.ts`. This adapter supplies a **standardized interface** for persisting and retrieving “knowledge entities” – the core objects that the ontology system manages.  

The sub‑component also participates in a **DAG‑based batch execution pipeline** described in `batch-analysis.yaml`. Each step in that YAML file declares explicit `depends_on` edges, and the runtime performs a **topological sort** to honour those dependencies. At run‑time, the work is distributed among multiple workers using a **work‑stealing** scheme that hinges on a shared `nextIndex` counter – the same mechanism found in `WaveController.runWithConcurrency()`.  

In addition, OntologyIntegration leans on **ontology metadata fields** (`entityType`, `metadata.ontologyClass`) to avoid redundant large‑language‑model (LLM) re‑classification. This optimisation is visible in the `PersistenceAgent.mapEntityToSharedMemory()` function. The component also inherits the **automatic JSON export sync** capability supplied by its parent, CodingPatterns, ensuring that any changes to the ontology are instantly reflected in downstream JSON artefacts.

## Architecture and Design  

The architecture of OntologyIntegration can be described as a **layered, adapter‑driven system** that couples a high‑performance storage layer with a DAG‑driven processing engine.  

1. **Adapter Pattern – GraphDatabaseAdapter**  
   The `GraphDatabaseAdapter` (`storage/graph-database-adapter.ts`) abstracts the underlying **LevelDB** store behind a clean, type‑safe API. All sibling components—**GraphDatabaseManagement** and **DataIngestion**—share this adapter, which guarantees a uniform contract for CRUD operations on knowledge entities. By centralising the storage concerns, OntologyIntegration can focus on ontology‑specific logic without being polluted by low‑level persistence details.  

2. **DAG Execution Model**  
   The batch pipeline defined in `batch-analysis.yaml` follows a **directed‑acyclic‑graph (DAG)** execution model. Each step lists `depends_on` edges, and the runtime performs a **topological sort** before dispatching work. This mirrors the approach used by the **BatchScheduler**, indicating a reusable scheduling framework across the code base. The DAG model enables fine‑grained parallelism while preserving deterministic ordering for steps that have data dependencies.  

3. **Work‑Stealing Concurrency**  
   Within each DAG step, the actual work is split among a pool of workers that coordinate through a **shared `nextIndex` counter**. When a worker finishes its current chunk, it atomically increments the counter to “steal” the next batch of tasks, a technique identical to `WaveController.runWithConcurrency()`. This design maximises CPU utilisation, reduces idle time, and scales naturally with the number of available cores.  

4. **Metadata‑Driven Classification Guard**  
   The ontology system tags each entity with `entityType` and `metadata.ontologyClass`. The `PersistenceAgent.mapEntityToSharedMemory()` routine checks these fields before invoking an LLM for classification. By short‑circuiting the expensive LLM call when the metadata already conveys the class, the component reduces latency and cost.  

5. **Automatic JSON Export Sync**  
   Because OntologyIntegration is a child of **CodingPatterns**, it inherits the JSON export synchronisation logic that the parent provides. Whenever the graph store is mutated, the adapter triggers a JSON dump that downstream consumers can immediately consume, guaranteeing data consistency across the ecosystem.

## Implementation Details  

### GraphDatabaseAdapter (`storage/graph-database-adapter.ts`)  
The adapter wraps **LevelDB**, exposing methods such as `saveEntity`, `getEntity`, `deleteEntity`, and `queryEntities`. Internally it serialises entities to a binary format optimised for LevelDB’s key‑value layout, then writes them using the LevelDB batch API for atomicity. The adapter also emits an event after each successful write, which the parent **CodingPatterns** component listens to in order to generate the automatic JSON export.  

### PersistenceAgent (`PersistenceAgent.mapEntityToSharedMemory()`)  
When a new entity arrives, the agent inspects `entityType` and `metadata.ontologyClass`. If those fields are populated, the function bypasses the LLM classification pipeline and directly maps the entity into the shared memory cache used by downstream workers. If the metadata is missing, the agent falls back to the LLM, updates the metadata, and then stores the result via the adapter. This dual‑path ensures both correctness (new entities are classified) and efficiency (already‑classified entities are not re‑processed).  

### DAG Scheduler (`batch-analysis.yaml` + runtime)  
Each YAML step contains a `name`, a `script` to execute, and a `depends_on` list. The scheduler reads the file, builds an in‑memory graph, and runs a **topological sort** to produce an execution order that respects all dependencies. For each step, the scheduler spawns a worker pool. The pool’s work‑stealing logic is implemented via a shared `nextIndex` counter stored in a `SharedArrayBuffer` (or equivalent atomic construct). Workers repeatedly perform:  

```ts
const myIndex = Atomics.add(nextIndex, 0, 1);
if (myIndex >= totalTasks) break;
processTask(taskList[myIndex]);
```  

This pattern mirrors the one in `WaveController.runWithConcurrency()`, confirming a reusable concurrency primitive across the code base.  

### LevelDB Choice  
LevelDB is chosen for its **high‑throughput reads/writes** and low‑latency random access. The adapter’s use of LevelDB enables OntologyIntegration to handle millions of ontology nodes without sacrificing performance, a requirement shared by its siblings **GraphDatabaseManagement** and **DataIngestion**.

## Integration Points  

1. **Parent – CodingPatterns**  
   OntologyIntegration inherits the **automatic JSON export sync** from CodingPatterns. The GraphDatabaseAdapter emits change events that CodingPatterns captures, serialises the entire graph (or delta) to JSON, and pushes it to any subscribed consumers.  

2. **Siblings – GraphDatabaseManagement & DataIngestion**  
   All three components rely on the same `GraphDatabaseAdapter`. This shared dependency ensures that any schema evolution or performance tuning (e.g., LevelDB compaction settings) benefits the entire family of components uniformly.  

3. **PersistenceAgent**  
   The agent bridges the ontology layer with the shared memory cache used by the DAG workers. It also serves as the gatekeeper for LLM classification, making it a critical integration point between the **LLM service**, the **graph store**, and the **batch execution engine**.  

4. **Batch Scheduler**  
   The DAG defined in `batch-analysis.yaml` may reference other sub‑components (e.g., data enrichment steps in DataIngestion). Because the scheduler respects `depends_on` edges, OntologyIntegration can be sequenced before or after those steps, allowing flexible orchestration across the system.  

5. **Concurrency Infrastructure**  
   The work‑stealing implementation re‑uses the `WaveController.runWithConcurrency()` primitive, meaning any configuration changes (thread pool size, back‑off strategy) made for the WaveController automatically affect OntologyIntegration’s concurrency behaviour.

## Usage Guidelines  

* **Persist via the Adapter** – Always interact with the graph through `GraphDatabaseAdapter`. Direct LevelDB access bypasses the JSON export sync and may lead to stale downstream data.  

* **Leverage Metadata** – When creating or updating entities, populate `entityType` and `metadata.ontologyClass` whenever possible. This prevents unnecessary LLM classification and speeds up the `PersistenceAgent.mapEntityToSharedMemory()` path.  

* **Define DAG Steps Explicitly** – When extending the batch pipeline, add new steps to `batch-analysis.yaml` with clear `depends_on` edges. This ensures the topological sorter can place the step correctly and that work‑stealing will distribute tasks evenly.  

* **Respect Concurrency Limits** – The shared `nextIndex` counter assumes atomic operations are available. Do not replace it with a non‑atomic counter or a custom queue unless you also replicate the atomic semantics used by `WaveController.runWithConcurrency()`.  

* **Monitor LevelDB Health** – Since OntologyIntegration, GraphDatabaseManagement, and DataIngestion all share the same LevelDB instance, monitor compaction, disk usage, and read/write latency at the system level. Adjust LevelDB options centrally to avoid performance regressions in any sibling.  

* **Test JSON Export** – After any schema change, run integration tests that verify the JSON export produced by CodingPatterns reflects the latest graph state. This guards against silent mismatches between the graph store and its JSON representation.

### Summary Deliverables  

1. **Architectural patterns identified**  
   * Adapter pattern (GraphDatabaseAdapter)  
   * DAG‑based execution with topological sorting (batch‑analysis.yaml)  
   * Work‑stealing concurrency via shared atomic counter (WaveController‑style)  
   * Metadata‑driven short‑circuiting for LLM classification  

2. **Design decisions and trade‑offs**  
   * **LevelDB** chosen for performance vs. richer query capabilities of a full graph DB – trades flexibility for speed.  
   * **Metadata guard** reduces LLM cost but requires upstream components to correctly set metadata.  
   * **Work‑stealing** maximises CPU utilisation but introduces contention on the atomic counter; acceptable given the low cost of atomic ops.  
   * **Unified adapter** simplifies code reuse across siblings but creates a single point of failure; mitigated by robust error handling in the adapter.  

3. **System structure insights**  
   * OntologyIntegration sits as a child of CodingPatterns, inheriting JSON sync.  
   * It shares the storage layer with GraphDatabaseManagement and DataIngestion, forming a cohesive persistence family.  
   * The batch DAG orchestrates cross‑component steps, allowing OntologyIntegration to be sequenced with other pipelines.  

4. **Scalability considerations**  
   * DAG parallelism and work‑stealing enable horizontal scaling across CPU cores.  
   * LevelDB’s high‑throughput design supports millions of entities, but sharding would be required for multi‑node scaling.  
   * Metadata‑based classification guard prevents LLM bottlenecks as the ontology grows.  

5. **Maintainability assessment**  
   * Centralised GraphDatabaseAdapter improves maintainability – changes propagate automatically to all consumers.  
   * Explicit `depends_on` edges in YAML make workflow changes transparent and version‑controllable.  
   * Reusing the WaveController concurrency primitive reduces duplicated logic and eases future refactors.  
   * The reliance on correct metadata introduces a potential source of bugs; thorough validation and unit tests are recommended.
