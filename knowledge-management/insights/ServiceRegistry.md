# ServiceRegistry

**Type:** SubComponent

The ServiceRegistry uses a service registry data structure to store service information, including service name, status, and configuration.

## What It Is  

The **ServiceRegistry** is a sub‑component that lives inside the **DockerizedServices** parent.  It provides a centralized data structure that records each service’s *name*, *status*, and *configuration* (Observation 1) together with richer *metadata* such as description and version (Observation 4).  The registry is the authoritative source for service discovery – clients query it to locate and access services (Observation 3).  To keep the registry responsive, a dedicated cache layer is employed (Observation 7), and the component actively monitors its own registry‑related metrics to spot anomalies (Observation 5).  The registry is protocol‑agnostic: it can speak both **HTTP** and **DNS**‑based service‑registry protocols (Observation 6).  Its lifecycle is coordinated by the sibling **ServiceManager**, which ensures that services are started, initialized, and kept healthy before they are entered into the registry (Observation 2).

## Architecture and Design  

The architecture follows a **registry‑centric** style where the ServiceRegistry is the hub for all service‑related information.  The design leans on **separation of concerns**: the ServiceRegistry focuses on storage, discovery, and metadata, while the ServiceManager handles lifecycle concerns, and the HealthChecker (sibling) validates health status before entries become visible.  This division mirrors a **Facade** pattern – the ServiceRegistry presents a simple discovery API while delegating lifecycle and health responsibilities to its peers.  

Multiple **protocol adapters** are built into the registry to support both HTTP and DNS registration flows (Observation 6).  This indicates an **Adapter**‑like approach where protocol‑specific logic is encapsulated behind a common interface, allowing the rest of the system to remain oblivious to the underlying transport.  The presence of a **service‑registry cache** (Observation 7) shows a classic **Cache‑Aside** strategy: callers read from the cache for speed, and the registry updates the cache when the authoritative store changes.  

Metrics monitoring (Observation 5) is woven into the registry loop, suggesting an **Observer**‑style feedback channel where metric collectors can trigger remediation or alerting pathways.  The overall composition is a loosely‑coupled graph: DockerizedServices → ServiceRegistry ↔ ServiceManager ↔ HealthChecker ↔ RetryMechanism, with DockerOrchestrator providing the container‑level isolation underneath.

## Implementation Details  

Even though the source tree does not expose concrete symbols, the observations outline the logical building blocks.  At its core the ServiceRegistry maintains a **service‑registry data structure** (likely a map or database table) that holds entries composed of *service name*, *status*, *configuration*, and *metadata* (Observations 1 & 4).  When a new service is started, the **ServiceManager** invokes the registry’s “register” operation after the **HealthChecker** confirms the service is healthy (Observation 2).  

Discovery logic (Observation 3) is implemented as a query interface that can be called by clients; the interface abstracts the underlying protocol, delegating to either an HTTP‑based registrar or a DNS‑based registrar depending on the service’s registration request (Observation 6).  The **service‑registry cache** (Observation 7) is refreshed either on write‑through events from the registry or via periodic syncs, reducing lookup latency for high‑frequency discovery calls.  

Metrics collection (Observation 5) likely hooks into key events—registration, deregistration, health state changes, cache hits/misses—and publishes them to a monitoring subsystem.  This enables automated detection of issues such as stale entries or sudden status flips, which can be acted upon by the **RetryMechanism** or external orchestration tools.

## Integration Points  

The ServiceRegistry sits directly under **DockerizedServices**, which uses `lib/service‑starter.js` to spin up containers.  The **ServiceManager** sibling consumes the registry’s API to add or remove services as containers are started or stopped.  The **HealthChecker** validates each service’s `/health` endpoint (as described in the parent component) before the ServiceManager calls the registry, ensuring only healthy services appear in discovery results.  

When a service needs to be discovered, client code reaches into the ServiceRegistry, which may forward the request to the appropriate protocol adapter (HTTP or DNS) based on the service’s registration metadata.  The **DockerOrchestrator** provides the runtime isolation but does not directly interact with the registry; instead it relies on the ServiceManager to keep the registry in sync with container state.  In failure scenarios, the **RetryMechanism** can be triggered by metric alerts emitted from the registry’s monitoring hooks, allowing exponential back‑off retries for problematic services.

## Usage Guidelines  

1. **Register Only After Health Confirmation** – Follow the established flow: start a service via `lib/service‑starter.js`, let the **HealthChecker** confirm health, then let **ServiceManager** invoke the ServiceRegistry registration.  Skipping health verification can pollute the registry with unhealthy entries.  

2. **Prefer the Cache for Discovery** – Client code should query the ServiceRegistry’s cache layer first; this reduces latency and off‑loads the underlying storage.  Ensure that any write‑through updates (e.g., service version bump) also invalidate or refresh the cache to avoid stale data.  

3. **Choose the Correct Protocol Adapter** – When registering a service, specify the intended protocol (HTTP or DNS) in the service configuration.  The registry will route the registration to the matching adapter; mixing protocols inadvertently can lead to discovery failures.  

4. **Monitor Registry Metrics** – Keep an eye on the metrics emitted by the registry (registration latency, cache hit ratio, error rates).  Use these signals to tune the **RetryMechanism** back‑off parameters or to trigger automated remediation scripts.  

5. **Keep Metadata Up‑to‑Date** – Service description and version are part of the registry entry (Observation 4).  Updating these fields promptly when a service is upgraded helps downstream consumers make compatibility decisions.

### Architectural patterns identified  
* Facade – ServiceRegistry presents a simple discovery API.  
* Adapter – Protocol‑specific registration (HTTP, DNS) behind a common interface.  
* Cache‑Aside – Service‑registry cache improves read performance.  
* Observer – Metrics monitoring feeds back into system health loops.  

### Design decisions and trade‑offs  
* **Lifecycle delegation** to ServiceManager isolates startup concerns but adds a dependency chain.  
* **Multi‑protocol support** adds flexibility at the cost of added adapter complexity.  
* **Caching** boosts latency performance but introduces potential staleness; cache invalidation must be carefully managed.  
* **Metric‑driven monitoring** enables proactive issue detection but requires a reliable telemetry pipeline.  

### System structure insights  
The ServiceRegistry is a central node in a loosely coupled graph of sibling components (ServiceManager, HealthChecker, RetryMechanism) under the DockerizedServices parent.  Its responsibilities are narrowly scoped to storage, discovery, and observability, while orchestration and container management are handled elsewhere (DockerOrchestrator).  

### Scalability considerations  
* Supporting both HTTP and DNS protocols allows the registry to scale across different networking environments.  
* The cache layer reduces read load on the primary store, enabling the registry to handle high‑frequency discovery traffic.  
* Metric collection must be lightweight to avoid becoming a bottleneck as the number of services grows.  

### Maintainability assessment  
The clear separation between lifecycle (ServiceManager), health verification (HealthChecker), and discovery (ServiceRegistry) promotes maintainability; changes to one area are unlikely to ripple across others.  However, the reliance on multiple adapters and cache synchronization introduces additional moving parts that require disciplined testing and documentation to keep the system coherent.

## Hierarchy Context

### Parent
- [DockerizedServices](./DockerizedServices.md) -- [LLM] The DockerizedServices component utilizes lib/service-starter.js to manage the startup of various services, including the LLMService, with retry logic and health verification. This is evident in the use of the startService function in lib/service-starter.js, which takes a service configuration object as an argument and attempts to start the service with a specified number of retries. The health verification is performed using the isServiceHealthy function, which checks the service's health by making a request to its health endpoint. For example, in the scripts/api-service.js file, the startAPIService function uses the startService function from lib/service-starter.js to start the API service. The use of this library ensures that services are properly initialized and ready for use, which is crucial for the operational integrity of the project. Furthermore, the integration of this library with the semantic analysis pipeline, as seen in the mcp-server-semantic-analysis component, highlights the component's role in supporting key project functionalities.

### Siblings
- [ServiceManager](./ServiceManager.md) -- The ServiceManager uses the startService function in lib/service-starter.js to start services with retry logic and health verification.
- [DockerOrchestrator](./DockerOrchestrator.md) -- The DockerOrchestrator uses Docker containerization to manage services, ensuring isolation and scalability.
- [HealthChecker](./HealthChecker.md) -- The HealthChecker uses the isServiceHealthy function to check the health of services by making requests to their health endpoints.
- [RetryMechanism](./RetryMechanism.md) -- The RetryMechanism uses a exponential backoff strategy to retry service startup, preventing cascading failures.
