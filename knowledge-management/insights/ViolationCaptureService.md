# ViolationCaptureService

**Type:** SubComponent

The ViolationCaptureService's responsibility for bridging live session logging with constraint monitor dashboard persistence is evident in its utilization of specific data capture and storage mechanisms.

## What It Is  

`ViolationCaptureService` is a **sub‑component** of the `ConstraintSystem` that lives in the file **`scripts/violation‑capture‑service.js`**. Its sole responsibility is to act as a bridge between the **live‑session logging** that occurs while a user or process interacts with the system and the **persistence layer** used by the constraint‑monitor dashboard. In practice, every violation that is detected during a session is captured by this service, transformed as needed, and then handed off to the `GraphDatabaseAdapter` (implemented in **`storage/graph-database-adapter.js`**) for durable storage. The service therefore sits at the intersection of real‑time event generation and long‑term analytical reporting, encapsulating the data‑capture workflow while keeping the rest of the `ConstraintSystem` agnostic of the underlying storage mechanics.  

## Architecture and Design  

The observations reveal a **modular architecture** built around clear separation of concerns. `ViolationCaptureService` isolates **data capture** from **data storage**: the former is performed in the script itself, while the latter is delegated to a dedicated `GraphDatabaseAdapter`. This division follows the **Adapter pattern** – the service does not interact directly with the graph database APIs; instead, it calls the adapter’s well‑defined interface, allowing the persistence mechanism to be swapped or upgraded without touching the capture logic.  

Interaction between components is also **loosely coupled**. The service receives raw violation events from the live‑session logger (the source is not named in the observations, but the contract is “live session logging”). After processing, it invokes the adapter’s methods to persist the data, enabling the **ConstraintSystem** dashboard to later query the graph store. This design mirrors the parent component’s overall modular strategy: sibling components such as `HookManager` (which uses `HookConfigLoader`) and `ContentValidationAgent` (which uses `content‑validation‑agent.ts`) each own a distinct responsibility and communicate through well‑defined interfaces. No monolithic “all‑in‑one” class is evident; instead, each sub‑component, including `ViolationCaptureService`, contributes a single, focused capability.  

## Implementation Details  

The core implementation resides in **`scripts/violation-capture-service.js`**. Although the source code is not enumerated in the observations, the following mechanics are explicitly called out:

1. **Data Capture Flow** – The script listens for or is invoked by the live‑session logging subsystem. Upon receipt of a violation event, it “triggers specific actions” (Observation 6). These actions likely include validation, enrichment (e.g., adding timestamps or session identifiers), and preparation of a payload suitable for graph storage.  

2. **Adapter Interaction** – Once the payload is ready, the service calls into the **`GraphDatabaseAdapter`** (Observation 7). The adapter lives in **`storage/graph-database-adapter.js`** and abstracts the underlying graph database (e.g., Neo4j, JanusGraph). By using this adapter, `ViolationCaptureService` does not need to manage connection handling, query construction, or transaction management directly.  

3. **Separation of Concerns** – The script’s responsibilities stop at the hand‑off; any retrieval, aggregation, or dashboard rendering is performed elsewhere in the `ConstraintSystem`. This clean cut makes the service easy to test in isolation – a mock adapter can be supplied to verify that the correct data structures are produced from raw logs.  

Because the observations mention “flexible and scalable way to capture and store data,” it is reasonable to infer that the script is written to handle high‑throughput streams, possibly batching writes or using asynchronous I/O to avoid blocking the logging pipeline.  

## Integration Points  

`ViolationCaptureService` is tightly integrated with three parts of the system:

* **Live‑Session Logger** – The source of violation events. While the exact module is not named, the service’s contract is to accept events in a predefined format, making it a consumer of the logging API.  

* **GraphDatabaseAdapter** – The persistence gateway located at **`storage/graph-database-adapter.js`**. All storage calls flow through this adapter, which presents a stable interface to the service.  

* **ConstraintSystem Dashboard** – The consumer of the persisted violation data. The dashboard queries the graph database (via the same adapter or a higher‑level repository) to render constraint‑monitor views.  

Because `ViolationCaptureService` is a sibling to `HookManager` and `ContentValidationAgent`, it shares the same **modular design philosophy**: each sub‑component declares its own dependencies and does not reach into the internals of its peers. This encourages independent evolution – for example, the `HookManager` can modify hook loading logic without impacting how violations are captured or stored.  

## Usage Guidelines  

Developers extending or using `ViolationCaptureService` should adhere to the following conventions:

1. **Treat the service as a pure bridge** – Do not embed business‑logic that belongs to validation or dashboard rendering inside the script. Keep the focus on transforming raw log entries into a format consumable by the `GraphDatabaseAdapter`.  

2. **Respect the adapter contract** – When calling the adapter, use only the public methods exposed in **`storage/graph-database-adapter.js`**. If a new storage capability is required (e.g., bulk import), extend the adapter rather than modifying the service directly.  

3. **Maintain async, non‑blocking behavior** – Since the service sits on a live‑session pipeline, ensure that any I/O with the adapter is performed asynchronously (promises or callbacks) to avoid back‑pressure on the logger.  

4. **Unit‑test with a mock adapter** – Because the adapter isolates the graph database, tests can replace it with a lightweight mock that asserts the correct payload structure. This keeps the test suite fast and focused on the capture logic.  

5. **Document event schemas** – Any change to the shape of the violation event emitted by the logger must be reflected in the service’s transformation code and the adapter’s storage schema. Keeping a versioned schema definition prevents mismatches that could corrupt persisted data.

### Architectural Patterns Identified
* **Modular Architecture** – Each sub‑component (including `ViolationCaptureService`) owns a single responsibility and interacts through defined interfaces.  
* **Adapter Pattern** – `GraphDatabaseAdapter` abstracts the concrete graph database, allowing the service to remain storage‑agnostic.  
* **Separation of Concerns** – Clear split between data capture (script) and data persistence (adapter).  

### Design Decisions and Trade‑offs
* **Bridge‑Centric Design** – Choosing a dedicated bridge service isolates live‑session concerns from persistence, simplifying both sides but adding an extra hop.  
* **Adapter Over Direct DB Calls** – Gains flexibility and testability at the cost of a thin indirection layer.  
* **Script‑Based Implementation** – Using a plain script (`.js`) makes rapid iteration easy, though it may lack the type safety of a compiled language; this is mitigated by strict interface contracts.  

### System Structure Insights
* `ViolationCaptureService` sits under the `ConstraintSystem` parent and is a peer to `HookManager`, `ContentValidationAgent`, and `GraphDatabaseAdapter`.  
* All siblings share the same modular philosophy, each encapsulating a distinct cross‑cutting concern (hooks, validation, persistence, violation capture).  
* The parent component orchestrates these sub‑components to provide a cohesive constraint‑monitoring platform.  

### Scalability Considerations
* The service’s “flexible and scalable” capture mechanism suggests it can handle high‑volume event streams, likely via asynchronous processing or batching.  
* By delegating storage to a graph database via an adapter, scaling the persistence layer (e.g., clustering the graph DB) does not require changes to the capture logic.  

### Maintainability Assessment
* **High** – The clear separation between capture and storage, together with the adapter abstraction, makes the codebase easy to understand, test, and evolve.  
* Adding new persistence back‑ends or modifying the capture workflow can be done in isolation, reducing regression risk.  
* The reliance on plain JavaScript scripts may require disciplined code reviews to enforce interface contracts, but the modular layout mitigates the risk of tangled dependencies.

## Hierarchy Context

### Parent
- [ConstraintSystem](./ConstraintSystem.md) -- The ConstraintSystem component employs a modular architecture, with each sub-component having specific responsibilities. For instance, the ContentValidationAgent (integrations/mcp-server-semantic-analysis/src/agents/content-validation-agent.ts) is used for entity content validation against the current codebase, while the HookConfigLoader (lib/agent-api/hooks/hook-config.js) is responsible for loading and merging hook configurations from multiple sources. This modular design allows for easier maintenance and updates, as each component can be modified or replaced without affecting the entire system. The ViolationCaptureService (scripts/violation-capture-service.js) is another example of this modular approach, as it bridges live session logging with constraint monitor dashboard persistence. The use of a GraphDatabaseAdapter (storage/graph-database-adapter.js) for persistence also contributes to this modular design, providing a flexible and scalable way to store and retrieve data.

### Siblings
- [HookManager](./HookManager.md) -- HookManager uses the HookConfigLoader (lib/agent-api/hooks/hook-config.js) to load and merge hook configurations from multiple sources.
- [ContentValidationAgent](./ContentValidationAgent.md) -- ContentValidationAgent uses the integrations/mcp-server-semantic-analysis/src/agents/content-validation-agent.ts to validate entity content.
- [GraphDatabaseAdapter](./GraphDatabaseAdapter.md) -- GraphDatabaseAdapter uses the storage/graph-database-adapter.js to provide a flexible and scalable way to store and retrieve data.
