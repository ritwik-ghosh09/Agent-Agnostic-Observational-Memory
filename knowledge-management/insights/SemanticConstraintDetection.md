# SemanticConstraintDetection

**Type:** Detail

The presence of CLAUDE-CODE-HOOK-FORMAT.md in the integrations/mcp-constraint-monitor/docs directory suggests that the service uses a specific hook format for constraint detection, possibly related to Claude Code.

## What It Is  

**SemanticConstraintDetection** is a documented capability of the **SemanticAnalysisService** that identifies and enforces *semantic* constraints on incoming data. The primary source of truth for this feature lives under the integration package **`integrations/mcp-constraint-monitor/docs/`**. Three markdown files give us the only concrete artefacts we can reference:

* `integrations/mcp-constraint-monitor/docs/semantic-constraint-detection.md` – the main description of the detection logic and its role inside the **SemanticAnalysisService**.  
* `integrations/mcp-constraint-monitor/docs/CLAUDE-CODE-HOOK-FORMAT.md` – defines a hook‑format that the detection engine expects when it is invoked, apparently tied to “Claude Code” payloads.  
* `integrations/mcp-constraint-monitor/docs/constraint-configuration.md` – outlines how the detection rules can be configured at runtime.

Together these documents show that **SemanticConstraintDetection** is not a stand‑alone micro‑service but a *sub‑component* of **SemanticAnalysisService**, responsible for analysing the semantic correctness of data according to a set of configurable constraints. The feature is exposed through a hook mechanism that external callers (or other internal services) can trigger using the CLAUDE‑CODE format.

## Architecture and Design  

The architecture that emerges from the documentation is a **configuration‑driven rule engine** embedded inside the **SemanticAnalysisService**. The design can be summarised as follows:

1. **Configuration Layer** – described in `constraint-configuration.md`, this layer stores the definition of each semantic constraint (e.g., allowed value ranges, required relationships, domain‑specific vocabularies). Because the file is a markdown spec rather than code, the actual storage format is likely a YAML/JSON file or a database table that the service reads at start‑up. The design decision to keep constraints externalised makes the system **extensible without code changes**.

2. **Hook Interface** – the `CLAUDE-CODE-HOOK-FORMAT.md` file defines a **hook contract** that callers must adhere to. The contract includes the shape of the payload (presumably a JSON object containing the data to be analysed and metadata such as a constraint identifier). By using a hook rather than a direct method call, the system gains **decoupling**: any producer that can emit a correctly‑shaped hook can trigger detection, which supports future expansion to other LLM back‑ends or external pipelines.

3. **Detection Engine** – while no concrete classes or functions are listed, the `semantic-constraint-detection.md` file indicates that the engine lives inside **SemanticAnalysisService**. The engine likely follows a **pipeline pattern**: it receives a hook payload, resolves the applicable constraints from the configuration layer, and sequentially validates the payload against each rule. The outcome (pass/fail, detailed violation report) is then returned to the caller or logged for monitoring.

No explicit architectural patterns such as micro‑services, event‑driven queues, or CQRS are mentioned, so we restrict our description to the observable **configuration‑driven rule engine** and **hook‑based invocation** patterns.

## Implementation Details  

Because the source repository contains **zero code symbols** for this component, we can only infer implementation details from the documentation:

* **SemanticConstraintDetection** is referenced as a *detail* of **SemanticAnalysisService**, implying that the detection logic is encapsulated in a class or module within the service’s codebase (e.g., `SemanticAnalysisService::ConstraintDetector`). The class would expose a public method that matches the CLAUDE‑CODE hook signature (e.g., `detectConstraints(payload: ClaudeHookPayload): DetectionResult`).

* The **CLAUDE‑CODE hook format** likely specifies required fields such as `inputText`, `metadata`, and a `constraintId` array. The hook parser would validate the payload structure before passing it downstream. This parsing step serves as a defensive guard, ensuring malformed requests are rejected early.

* The **constraint configuration** described in `constraint-configuration.md` probably follows a hierarchical schema: a top‑level list of constraint definitions, each containing a unique identifier, a human‑readable description, and the rule logic (e.g., regex patterns, numeric bounds, ontology references). At runtime the detection engine would load this configuration once (or watch for hot‑reloading) and cache it for fast lookup.

* The detection algorithm itself would iterate over the applicable constraints, applying each rule to the incoming data. For simple syntactic checks (regex, range), the implementation could be a direct function call. For richer semantic checks (ontology validation, LLM‑assisted reasoning), the engine might delegate to an LLM service (the same LLM that powers **SemanticAnalysisService**) and interpret the response against the configured expectation.

* The output of the detection process is probably a structured result object containing a boolean `isValid` flag, a list of `violations` (each with a `constraintId` and a descriptive message), and possibly a `severity` level. This result can be consumed by downstream components (e.g., request throttlers, audit loggers) or returned to the original caller.

## Integration Points  

* **Parent – SemanticAnalysisService** – As a child detail, **SemanticConstraintDetection** is invoked by the broader analysis workflow. When the service receives an input payload, it first runs the standard semantic analysis (topic extraction, intent detection, etc.) and then calls the constraint detector to enforce business‑level rules before proceeding to downstream actions.

* **Sibling Components** – Other details of **SemanticAnalysisService** (e.g., *EntityExtraction*, *IntentClassification*) likely share the same hook infrastructure and configuration loading mechanisms. They may also reuse the CLAUDE‑CODE hook format, providing a consistent integration surface across the service.

* **External Callers** – Any component that can emit a CLAUDE‑CODE‑compliant hook can trigger detection. This includes:
  * Front‑end gateways that forward user input.
  * Batch processing pipelines that validate stored records.
  * Other internal services that need to enforce constraints before persisting data.

* **Configuration Management** – The `constraint-configuration.md` file suggests that constraints can be edited without code changes. In practice, this implies an operational integration with a configuration store (e.g., a Git‑backed config repo, a feature‑flag service, or a database). The detection engine must therefore expose a **reload** or **watch** capability to pick up changes without a full service restart.

* **Monitoring & Auditing** – Although not documented, a typical integration point for constraint detection is a logging/auditing subsystem that records each violation for compliance reporting. The presence of a dedicated documentation folder (`mcp-constraint-monitor`) hints that monitoring is a first‑class concern.

## Usage Guidelines  

1. **Respect the CLAUDE‑CODE Hook Contract** – When invoking **SemanticConstraintDetection**, callers must construct payloads that conform exactly to the format described in `CLAUDE-CODE-HOOK-FORMAT.md`. Missing fields or incorrect data types will cause the hook parser to reject the request outright.

2. **Define Constraints Declaratively** – All semantic rules should be expressed in `constraint-configuration.md` (or its underlying data store). Developers should avoid hard‑coding rule logic in code; instead, they should add or modify constraint entries, leveraging the configuration‑driven nature of the engine.

3. **Version Constraints Carefully** – Because constraints are externalised, any change can affect all callers simultaneously. Use version identifiers or namespacing within the configuration file to roll out new constraints gradually and maintain backward compatibility.

4. **Handle Detection Results Gracefully** – The detection result will contain a list of violations. Callers should treat a `false` `isValid` flag as a signal to abort or remediate the operation, and they should surface the human‑readable messages to operators or end‑users where appropriate.

5. **Monitor Performance** – Since constraint checking may involve LLM calls for complex semantics, developers should benchmark the latency impact of each constraint type. If a particular rule proves too costly, consider simplifying it or moving it to an asynchronous validation stage.

6. **Leverage Reload Mechanisms** – When updating the constraint configuration, ensure the service’s reload endpoint (if any) is invoked, or confirm that the hot‑reload watcher picks up the change. This avoids stale constraint sets persisting in memory.

### Architectural Patterns Identified  

* **Configuration‑Driven Rule Engine** – Constraints are externalised and loaded at runtime.  
* **Hook‑Based Invocation** – A defined payload contract (`CLAUDE‑CODE`) decouples callers from the detection implementation.  

### Design Decisions and Trade‑offs  

* **Extensibility vs. Runtime Overhead** – Externalising constraints makes the system highly extensible but introduces a runtime lookup cost and the need for a reliable reload mechanism.  
* **Decoupling via Hooks** – Hooks provide flexibility for multiple producers but require strict contract adherence and validation logic.  

### System Structure Insights  

* **SemanticConstraintDetection** sits as a child detail inside **SemanticAnalysisService**, sharing configuration and hook infrastructure with sibling analysis components.  
* The documentation‑only presence suggests that the actual code resides in the service’s core module, likely hidden behind an internal API that respects the documented hook format.  

### Scalability Considerations  

* Because each detection may invoke LLM services, scaling horizontally (adding more instances of **SemanticAnalysisService**) is the primary way to handle increased load.  
* The configuration store must be read‑optimised (cached) to avoid bottlenecks when many instances resolve constraints simultaneously.  

### Maintainability Assessment  

* **High maintainability** for business rule changes: developers edit the constraint configuration rather than code.  
* **Potential fragility** in the hook contract: any deviation in payload shape forces a code change in the parser. Clear versioned documentation (as provided) mitigates this risk.  
* Lack of visible code symbols makes onboarding harder; adding inline code comments or linking the documentation to concrete classes would improve traceability.
