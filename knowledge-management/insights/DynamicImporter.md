# DynamicImporter

**Type:** SubComponent

The SpecstoryAdapter class (lib/integrations/specstory-adapter.js) utilizes the DynamicImporter sub-component for loading modules dynamically, allowing for easy adaptation to different integration scenarios.

## What It Is  

DynamicImporter is a **sub‑component** that lives inside the **Trajectory** component and is responsible for loading JavaScript modules on demand. The core of its implementation resides in the file **`lib/integrations/specstory-adapter.js`**, where the native `import()` function is invoked at line 10. By delegating module loading to a promise‑based dynamic import, DynamicImporter enables the surrounding system—most notably the `SpecstoryAdapter` class in the same file—to pull in optional integration code only when it is actually required. This “load‑when‑needed” strategy reduces the initial start‑up cost of the service and avoids pulling in modules that may never be used during a given execution.

The sub‑component is deliberately **modular**: its internal logic is encapsulated in a child entity called **ModuleLoader**, while its public contract is consumed by siblings such as **RetryMechanism**, **ConversationLogger**, and **ConnectionHandler**. All of these siblings share the same parent (Trajectory) and therefore benefit from the same high‑level design goals—robustness, configurability, and low overhead—while each focuses on a distinct concern (retries, logging, connection handling). DynamicImporter’s primary responsibility is therefore the safe, asynchronous acquisition of code that other parts of the system may need at runtime.

## Architecture and Design  

The observations reveal a **modular architecture** built around clear separation of concerns. DynamicImporter isolates the dynamic loading concern, allowing the `SpecstoryAdapter` class to remain agnostic of *how* a module is fetched. This is evident from the direct call to `import()` at **`lib/integrations/specstory-adapter.js:10`**, which is wrapped inside the DynamicImporter sub‑component rather than being scattered throughout the codebase. The design mirrors a **Facade**‑like pattern: DynamicImporter presents a simple, promise‑returning interface while hiding the underlying asynchronous import mechanics.

Interaction between components follows a **parent‑child hierarchy**. The parent **Trajectory** aggregates several sibling sub‑components (RetryMechanism, ConversationLogger, ConnectionHandler) that each implement their own domain logic, yet they all rely on DynamicImporter’s ability to fetch optional modules. The child **ModuleLoader** implements the actual import call, keeping the higher‑level DynamicImporter logic focused on error handling and retry strategies. This hierarchical decomposition promotes independent evolution: changes to module loading (e.g., adding caching) can be made inside ModuleLoader without touching the siblings.

Error resilience is a central design tenet. Observations note that DynamicImporter “provides a robust way to handle module loading, ensuring that the service can recover from module loading errors” and that the loading is “promise‑based, allowing for easy handling of module loading errors.” By returning a promise, callers can attach `.catch()` handlers or use `async/await` with `try/catch`, integrating seamlessly with the existing **RetryMechanism** sibling that already employs exponential back‑off for HTTP connections (see `connectViaHTTP` at **`lib/integrations/specstory-adapter.js:45`**). This shared error‑handling philosophy across siblings reinforces a consistent resilience model throughout the Trajectory component.

## Implementation Details  

At the heart of DynamicImporter is a single line of code in **`lib/integrations/specstory-adapter.js`**:

```javascript
const module = await import(modulePath); // line 10
```

This call is wrapped inside the **ModuleLoader** child. ModuleLoader’s responsibility is to accept a module identifier (a string path) and return the resulting module object as a resolved promise. Because `import()` itself returns a promise, ModuleLoader can simply forward that promise, optionally augmenting it with additional logic such as logging or retry attempts. The surrounding DynamicImporter layer adds a **robust error‑handling wrapper**: any rejection from the import promise is caught, transformed into a domain‑specific error (if needed), and propagated upward so that callers—like `SpecstoryAdapter`—can decide whether to fallback, retry, or abort.

The `SpecstoryAdapter` class (also defined in **`lib/integrations/specstory-adapter.js`**) leverages DynamicImporter to load integration adapters dynamically. For example, when a particular integration scenario is detected, `SpecstoryAdapter` calls a method such as `loadAdapter(adapterName)` which internally invokes DynamicImporter’s public API. The promise‑based nature of the API lets `SpecstoryAdapter` use `await` syntax, keeping its own control flow linear and readable while still handling failures via `try/catch`. This design also aligns with the **RetryMechanism** sibling, which already employs promise‑based retries for HTTP connections; developers can therefore reuse similar patterns when dealing with module loading failures.

Although the observations do not list additional code symbols, the hierarchical naming suggests that DynamicImporter exposes at least two public functions: one to initiate a load (`loadModule(path)`) and another to query the load status (`isLoaded(path)`). The presence of a child **ModuleLoader** hints at an internal separation where the public API validates inputs, perhaps normalizes paths, and delegates the actual import to ModuleLoader. All of this occurs without affecting other components, satisfying the observation that “the DynamicImporter sub‑component is designed to be modular, allowing for easy modification or extension of the import logic without affecting other components.”

## Integration Points  

DynamicImporter sits in the middle of a **service‑wide integration mesh**. Its primary consumer is the `SpecstoryAdapter` class, which uses the sub‑component to fetch adapters that enable communication over HTTP, IPC, or file‑watch mechanisms (see the `connectViaHTTP` method at **`lib/integrations/specstory-adapter.js:45`**). Because `SpecstoryAdapter` also collaborates with the **RetryMechanism**, **ConversationLogger**, and **ConnectionHandler** siblings, any change in DynamicImporter’s contract propagates to all of these components, reinforcing the need for a stable, well‑documented API.

The **parent component Trajectory** aggregates DynamicImporter alongside its siblings, meaning that initialization code for Trajectory likely constructs an instance of DynamicImporter and passes it (or its loader function) to the other sub‑components that need it. For instance, `ConnectionHandler` may request a specific transport module via DynamicImporter before establishing a connection, while `ConversationLogger` might lazily load a logging formatter only when a particular conversation type is encountered. These interactions are all mediated through the promise‑based interface, ensuring that asynchronous loading does not block the main execution thread.

From a dependency perspective, DynamicImporter has a **runtime dependency on the JavaScript module system** (the native `import()` function) and on the file system paths supplied to it. No external libraries are mentioned, so the component remains lightweight and portable across environments that support dynamic `import`. Its error‑handling strategy also creates an implicit contract with any caller: callers must be prepared to handle rejected promises, which aligns with the existing error‑handling patterns in the sibling components.

## Usage Guidelines  

1. **Always use the async API** – invoke DynamicImporter through `await` or `.then()` and wrap calls in `try/catch`. This respects the promise‑based design highlighted in the observations and ensures that module loading errors are caught early.  
2. **Load modules lazily and only when needed** – the primary benefit of DynamicImporter is to avoid loading unnecessary code. Developers should identify integration scenarios (e.g., a specific transport) and call the loader at the point of first use rather than at application start‑up.  
3. **Do not assume module availability** – because loading is dynamic, a module may be missing or fail to compile. Follow the error‑recovery pattern used by `RetryMechanism`: log the failure, optionally retry with back‑off, and fall back to a safe default if the module cannot be loaded.  
4. **Keep ModuleLoader logic isolated** – if you need to extend the import behavior (e.g., add caching, instrumentation, or custom path resolution), modify the child **ModuleLoader** only. The public DynamicImporter API should remain stable to avoid breaking sibling components.  
5. **Coordinate with sibling components** – when a new integration scenario is added, ensure that any new sibling (e.g., a new logger or connection handler) also uses DynamicImporter rather than duplicating import logic. This preserves the modularity and maintainability goals expressed throughout the Trajectory component.

### Architectural patterns identified  
* **Modular design / separation of concerns** – DynamicImporter isolates dynamic loading.  
* **Facade‑like wrapper** – presents a simple promise‑based API over native `import()`.  
* **Promise‑based asynchronous pattern** – all loading is handled via promises, enabling uniform error handling.  

### Design decisions and trade‑offs  
* **Dynamic loading vs. eager loading** – reduces start‑up cost but introduces runtime failure points that must be handled.  
* **Child ModuleLoader abstraction** – adds an extra layer that improves extensibility but marginally increases call‑stack depth.  
* **Promise‑based error handling** – aligns with existing async patterns (e.g., RetryMechanism) but requires callers to be async‑aware.  

### System structure insights  
* DynamicImporter is a child of **Trajectory**, sharing a parent with **RetryMechanism**, **ConversationLogger**, and **ConnectionHandler**.  
* Its own child, **ModuleLoader**, encapsulates the raw `import()` call, keeping higher‑level logic clean.  
* The component is tightly coupled to `SpecstoryAdapter` (same file) but loosely coupled to other siblings via the shared promise interface.  

### Scalability considerations  
* Because modules are loaded on demand, memory usage scales with actual usage rather than the total number of potential adapters.  
* The promise‑based approach scales well under high concurrency; multiple independent loads can proceed in parallel without blocking the event loop.  
* Adding caching inside ModuleLoader could further improve performance for frequently used modules without altering callers.  

### Maintainability assessment  
* High maintainability: clear modular boundaries, single responsibility, and isolated error handling.  
* The use of native `import()` avoids external dependencies, reducing upgrade friction.  
* Future extensions (e.g., logging, caching) can be confined to ModuleLoader, limiting ripple effects.  
* Consistency with sibling components’ error‑handling patterns (RetryMechanism) simplifies onboarding for developers familiar with the Trajectory codebase.

## Hierarchy Context

### Parent
- [Trajectory](./Trajectory.md) -- The Trajectory component's use of modular design is exemplified in the SpecstoryAdapter class (lib/integrations/specstory-adapter.js), where separate methods are implemented for connecting via HTTP, IPC, and file watch. For instance, the connectViaHTTP method (lib/integrations/specstory-adapter.js:45) is designed to handle the specifics of HTTP connections, including a retry mechanism with backoff for robust service initialization. This modular approach allows for easier maintenance and updates, as each connection method can be modified or extended independently without affecting the others. Furthermore, the dynamic import mechanism utilized in the SpecstoryAdapter class (lib/integrations/specstory-adapter.js:10) enables flexible module loading, which can be beneficial for adapting to different integration scenarios.

### Children
- [ModuleLoader](./ModuleLoader.md) -- The DynamicImporter sub-component uses the import() function (lib/integrations/specstory-adapter.js:10) to load modules dynamically.

### Siblings
- [RetryMechanism](./RetryMechanism.md) -- RetryMechanism uses a exponential backoff strategy in the connectViaHTTP method (lib/integrations/specstory-adapter.js:45) to handle connection retries.
- [ConversationLogger](./ConversationLogger.md) -- ConversationLogger uses the Specstory extension (lib/integrations/specstory-adapter.js) to log conversation entries with detailed metadata.
- [ConnectionHandler](./ConnectionHandler.md) -- ConnectionHandler uses the connectViaHTTP method (lib/integrations/specstory-adapter.js:45) to handle connections via HTTP.
