# HttpConnector

**Type:** Detail

The absence of other connector types, such as IpcConnector or FileWatchConnector, in the provided context implies that HTTP connections are the primary or sole connection method for the ConnectionHandler sub-component.

## What It Is  

`HttpConnector` lives inside the **ConnectionHandler** component and is exercised through the `connectViaHTTP` function that resides in **specstory‑adapter.js**. The only concrete evidence of its existence is the call chain — `ConnectionHandler` invokes `connectViaHTTP`, which in turn implements the HTTP‑based link to external services. No alternative connector implementations (e.g., `IpcConnector` or `FileWatchConnector`) appear in the supplied observations, indicating that `HttpConnector` is the sole concrete connector type currently supported. In practice, `HttpConnector` is the concrete embodiment of the system’s strategy for reaching out to remote APIs, webhooks, or any service that speaks HTTP/HTTPS.

## Architecture and Design  

The architecture follows a **strategy‑oriented** approach: `ConnectionHandler` delegates the actual transport mechanism to a connector implementation. By wiring `ConnectionHandler` to `HttpConnector` through the `connectViaHTTP` entry point, the design isolates protocol‑specific logic (the HTTP request construction, header handling, response parsing) from higher‑level connection orchestration. This separation mirrors a **Facade** pattern where `ConnectionHandler` offers a simplified interface while `HttpConnector` (via `connectViaHTTP`) hides the complexity of HTTP communication.

Because the observations explicitly note the *absence* of other connector types, the current design can be interpreted as a **single‑protocol specialization**. The system has deliberately chosen to standardize on HTTP rather than supporting a heterogeneous set of transports (IPC, file‑watch, etc.). This decision reduces the surface area of the connector layer, simplifying both the implementation and the testing strategy, but it also limits extensibility to non‑HTTP scenarios unless a new connector class is introduced.

Interaction flow (as inferred from the observations):
1. A consumer component calls a method on `ConnectionHandler`.
2. `ConnectionHandler` forwards the request to `specstory-adapter.js` by invoking `connectViaHTTP`.
3. `connectViaHTTP` contains the concrete logic of `HttpConnector`, performing the HTTP request and returning the result to `ConnectionHandler`.

## Implementation Details  

The only concrete implementation artifact mentioned is the **`connectViaHTTP`** function inside **specstory‑adapter.js**. While the source code is not provided, the naming convention strongly suggests that this function encapsulates all steps required to open an HTTP connection: URL resolution, request method selection (GET, POST, etc.), payload serialization, header configuration, and response handling. Because `HttpConnector` is described as a child of `ConnectionHandler`, it is reasonable to infer that `connectViaHTTP` either constructs an instance of `HttpConnector` or directly implements its responsibilities.

Key mechanical points that can be deduced:
- **Standardized HTTP usage** – the connector relies on well‑known HTTP semantics, likely leveraging a library such as `fetch`, `axios`, or Node’s native `http/https` modules.
- **Error propagation** – given the role of `ConnectionHandler` as a coordinator, any HTTP error (network failure, non‑2xx status) would be bubbled up through `connectViaHTTP` so that the caller can react appropriately.
- **Configuration handling** – any authentication tokens, time‑outs, or custom headers required by external services are probably passed as arguments to `connectViaHTTP` and then applied within `HttpConnector`.

Because no other connector classes are referenced, the implementation is streamlined: there is a single code path for all outbound communications, reducing duplication and centralizing HTTP concerns.

## Integration Points  

`HttpConnector` integrates with the broader system exclusively through **ConnectionHandler**. Any component that needs to talk to an external HTTP service does not interact with `HttpConnector` directly; it instead calls the higher‑level API exposed by `ConnectionHandler`. This indirection creates a clear dependency graph:

- **Upstream**: Consumer modules → `ConnectionHandler` → `connectViaHTTP` (in `specstory-adapter.js`) → `HttpConnector`.
- **Downstream**: `HttpConnector` → external HTTP services (REST APIs, webhooks, etc.).

The only visible dependency is the **specstory‑adapter.js** module, which houses the `connectViaHTTP` function. No other adapters, protocol libraries, or configuration files are mentioned, implying that the HTTP client configuration is either hard‑coded within this file or supplied via parameters from `ConnectionHandler`.

## Usage Guidelines  

Developers should treat `ConnectionHandler` as the sole entry point for outbound HTTP communication. When adding a new external service integration, the recommended steps are:

1. **Define the request contract** (URL, method, payload) in the calling component.
2. **Invoke the appropriate `ConnectionHandler` method** that internally routes to `connectViaHTTP`. Do not call `connectViaHTTP` or any internal `HttpConnector` APIs directly; this preserves encapsulation.
3. **Handle responses and errors** at the `ConnectionHandler` level, respecting the error‑propagation semantics implied by the `connectViaHTTP` function.
4. **Avoid mixing protocols** – because the current design only supports HTTP, any attempt to use IPC, file‑watch, or other transports should first be evaluated against the architectural intent. If a non‑HTTP requirement emerges, a new connector class would need to be introduced, and the `ConnectionHandler` would have to be extended to select the appropriate strategy.

Adhering to these conventions ensures that the system remains consistent with its single‑protocol design and that future maintainers can locate the HTTP logic in a single, well‑defined location.

### Architectural patterns identified  
- **Strategy / Facade** – `ConnectionHandler` delegates to `HttpConnector` via `connectViaHTTP`.  
- **Single‑Protocol Specialization** – the system intentionally limits itself to HTTP.

### Design decisions and trade‑offs  
- **Prioritizing HTTP** simplifies the connector layer and reduces code duplication, but limits extensibility to other transport mechanisms.  
- **Centralizing HTTP logic** in `specstory-adapter.js` eases testing and maintenance but creates a single point of failure if the HTTP client needs to be swapped.

### System structure insights  
- `ConnectionHandler` is the parent component; `HttpConnector` is its sole child. No sibling connectors are present, reinforcing the HTTP‑only stance.  
- All external communication funnels through the `connectViaHTTP` function, making it the critical integration hotspot.

### Scalability considerations  
- Because only one connector type exists, scaling horizontally (e.g., adding more instances) does not require protocol‑specific load‑balancing logic.  
- However, high request volumes will stress the single HTTP client implementation; scaling may require internal connection pooling or async handling within `connectViaHTTP`.

### Maintainability assessment  
- **Positive**: Minimal connector surface area, clear responsibility separation, and a single code location for HTTP handling simplify debugging and updates.  
- **Negative**: Future protocol diversification will demand architectural refactoring (introducing new connector classes and a selector mechanism). The current design’s rigidity could increase the cost of such extensions.
