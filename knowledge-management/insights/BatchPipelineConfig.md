# BatchPipelineConfig

**Type:** Detail

The pipeline configuration is expected to define the order of execution for the batch processing steps, ensuring that dependencies are met before proceeding.

## What It Is  

`BatchPipelineConfig` is the concrete representation of the batch‑processing pipeline definition that lives in the **`batch‑analysis.yaml`** file. The file resides alongside the `Pipeline` component (the parent of `BatchPipelineConfig`) and is read at runtime by the `Pipeline` class. Its purpose is to declare the individual processing steps, the explicit dependencies between those steps, and the required execution order for a batch job. Because the configuration is expressed in YAML, engineers can adjust the workflow—adding, removing, or re‑ordering steps—without touching compiled code.

## Architecture and Design  

The design follows a **configuration‑driven (declarative) architecture**: the static structure of the batch workflow is externalised from the executable logic. `Pipeline` acts as the orchestrator; it loads `BatchPipelineConfig` from `batch‑analysis.yaml`, validates the dependency graph, and then drives the execution of each step in the prescribed order. This separation of concerns mirrors the **“External Configuration” pattern**, where the system’s behaviour is dictated by data rather than hard‑coded control flow.

Interaction is straightforward: `Pipeline` invokes a YAML parser (likely a library such as SnakeYAML or PyYAML) to deserialize the file into an in‑memory model that `BatchPipelineConfig` represents. The model then provides methods for the orchestrator to query step definitions and dependency relationships. Because the configuration is purely declarative, the pipeline can be extended simply by editing the YAML file, which aligns with the observed design decision to “allow easy modification and extension … without requiring code changes.”

## Implementation Details  

* **File location** – The primary source of truth is the `batch‑analysis.yaml` file. Its path is hard‑coded or supplied to the `Pipeline` component during initialization, ensuring a deterministic load location.  
* **Loading mechanism** – Within the `Pipeline` class, a call such as `loadConfig("batch‑analysis.yaml")` reads the file, parses the YAML, and constructs a `BatchPipelineConfig` instance. This instance encapsulates collections of **step objects** and a **dependency map** that the orchestrator consults.  
* **Dependency handling** – The configuration must list each step’s prerequisite steps. `BatchPipelineConfig` likely provides a method like `getExecutionOrder()` that performs a topological sort on the dependency graph, guaranteeing that every step’s inputs are satisfied before it runs.  
* **Extensibility** – Adding a new step is a matter of appending a new entry to the YAML with its name and dependencies. No new Java/Python classes are required unless the step’s implementation itself changes, keeping the pipeline definition lightweight and data‑centric.

## Integration Points  

`BatchPipelineConfig` is tightly coupled with its parent, the **`Pipeline`** component. The parent is responsible for:

1. **Reading the configuration** – invoking the YAML parser and handling any I/O errors.  
2. **Validating the graph** – ensuring there are no circular dependencies or missing step definitions.  
3. **Executing steps** – using the ordered list supplied by `BatchPipelineConfig` to invoke the actual processing logic (which may reside in sibling classes or external services).  

Because `BatchPipelineConfig` is purely declarative, it does not directly call other services; instead, it supplies data that the `Pipeline` passes to step implementations. Any sibling components that implement concrete steps must conform to the contract implied by the configuration (e.g., expose a `run()` method that the orchestrator can invoke).

## Usage Guidelines  

* **Keep the YAML authoritative** – All changes to the batch workflow should be performed in `batch‑analysis.yaml`. Avoid hard‑coding step order in code; let the configuration drive execution.  
* **Maintain clear dependency declarations** – When adding a step, list every prerequisite explicitly to preserve the topological ordering guarantees. Missing dependencies will cause the `Pipeline` to reject the configuration at startup.  
* **Validate after edits** – Run the pipeline’s validation routine (often exposed as a `--dry-run` or `validateConfig` command) after any modification to catch syntax errors or circular dependencies early.  
* **Version control the file** – Because the configuration determines runtime behaviour, treat `batch‑analysis.yaml` as a first‑class source file; commit changes with descriptive messages.  
* **Document step semantics** – Include comments inside the YAML (supported by the format) to explain what each step does and why particular dependencies exist. This aids future maintainers and reduces accidental mis‑ordering.

### Architectural Patterns Identified  
1. **External Configuration / Declarative Pipeline** – Behaviour is defined outside of code in a YAML file.  
2. **Topological Sort for Dependency Resolution** – Implicitly used to derive execution order from declared dependencies.

### Design Decisions and Trade‑offs  
* **Decision:** Store pipeline definition in YAML rather than hard‑coding.  
  * **Benefit:** Easy to modify, no recompilation, clear separation of concerns.  
  * **Trade‑off:** Runtime validation is required; errors surface only when the file is parsed.  
* **Decision:** Let `Pipeline` be the sole consumer of `BatchPipelineConfig`.  
  * **Benefit:** Centralised orchestration simplifies reasoning about execution flow.  
  * **Trade‑off:** Tight coupling means changes to the configuration format may require updates to the orchestrator.

### System Structure Insights  
`BatchPipelineConfig` sits as a child data model of `Pipeline`. It does not have its own children; instead, it describes a set of steps that are implemented elsewhere (typically sibling classes). The hierarchy is shallow: **Pipeline → BatchPipelineConfig → step definitions (data only).**

### Scalability Considerations  
* **Horizontal scaling** – Because the configuration is read once at startup, the same `batch‑analysis.yaml` can be shared across multiple pipeline instances, enabling parallel batch jobs without re‑defining the workflow.  
* **Complexity growth** – As the number of steps and dependencies increases, the topological sort performed by `BatchPipelineConfig` may become a bottleneck; however, YAML parsing and sorting are lightweight compared to the actual batch work, so impact is minimal.  
* **Extensibility** – Adding new steps does not affect existing ones, supporting incremental scaling of the processing pipeline.

### Maintainability Assessment  
The declarative nature of `BatchPipelineConfig` greatly enhances maintainability: changes are isolated to a single, human‑readable file, and the orchestrator (`Pipeline`) does not need to be altered for most workflow adjustments. The primary maintenance burden lies in keeping the dependency graph accurate and ensuring that step implementations stay compatible with the configuration schema. Regular validation and thorough documentation within the YAML file mitigate the risk of configuration drift.

## Hierarchy Context

### Parent
- [Pipeline](./Pipeline.md) -- The Pipeline uses a batch-analysis.yaml file to define the steps and dependencies for the batch processing pipeline.
