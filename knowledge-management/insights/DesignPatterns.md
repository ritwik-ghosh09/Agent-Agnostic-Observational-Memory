# DesignPatterns

**Type:** SubComponent

The integrations/code-graph-rag/docs/claude-code-setup.md file provides setup instructions for the Graph-Code MCP Server, potentially using design patterns like the builder pattern for configuration.

## What It Is  

The **DesignPatterns** sub‑component lives at the intersection of several concrete modules inside the broader **CodingPatterns** component.  Its most visible artefacts are the `GraphDatabaseAdapter` class in `storage/graph-database-adapter.ts`, the CodeGraph RAG documentation in `integrations/code-graph-rag/README.md`, and a handful of usage and configuration guides (e.g., `copi/USAGE.md`, `mcp-constraint-monitor/docs/CLAUDE-CODE-HOOK‑FORMAT.md`).  Together these files describe how the system organises its core logic around reusable architectural idioms –‑ singleton for the graph store, graph‑oriented data structures for code‑base navigation, and a collection of higher‑level patterns (factory, observer, builder, decorator, strategy) that shape how developers extend or configure the platform.  In short, **DesignPatterns** is the documented catalogue of the recurring structural and behavioural solutions that the rest of the **CodingPatterns** ecosystem relies on.

## Architecture and Design  

The architecture is deliberately centred on a **graph‑centric** data model.  The `GraphDatabaseAdapter` ( `storage/graph-database-adapter.ts` ) is instantiated as a **singleton**, guaranteeing a single, globally‑available graph database backed by Graphology + LevelDB.  This ensures that every component—whether the CodeGraph RAG engine, the constraint monitor, or the Copi CLI—operates against the same consistent graph instance, eliminating duplication and synchronisation hazards.  

On top of this shared graph layer, the **CodeGraph RAG** system (documented in `integrations/code‑graph‑rag/README.md`) follows a **graph pattern**: code entities become vertices, relationships become edges, and retrieval is performed via graph traversals.  The README emphasises handling “large codebases” and “efficient query performance”, indicating that the architecture expects the graph to act as the primary index for code‑level reasoning.  

The surrounding tooling hints at several auxiliary patterns:  

* **Factory** – the Copi CLI wrapper (`copi/USAGE.md`) appears to select concrete command classes based on user input, a classic factory‑style decoupling of object creation from the calling code.  
* **Observer** – the hook format described in `mcp‑constraint‑monitor/docs/CLAUDE‑CODE‑HOOK‑FORMAT.md` is poised to broadcast state changes to interested listeners, matching the observer pattern’s publish/subscribe contract.  
* **Builder** – the setup guide for the Graph‑Code MCP Server (`integrations/code‑graph‑rag/docs/claude‑code‑setup.md`) walks the user through step‑by‑step configuration, a narrative that maps naturally to a builder that assembles a complex configuration object.  
* **Decorator** – the status‑line integration (`copi/docs/STATUS‑LINE‑QUICK‑REFERENCE.md`) extends an existing UI element without altering its core, a textbook use of the decorator pattern.  
* **Strategy** – the constraint‑configuration guide (`mcp‑constraint‑monitor/docs/constraint‑configuration.md`) outlines interchangeable constraint policies, suggesting a strategy‑based plug‑in point for different validation behaviours.  

These patterns are not isolated; they interlock through the shared graph instance and common configuration interfaces, forming a cohesive, pattern‑rich architecture.

## Implementation Details  

At the heart of the implementation is the **`GraphDatabaseAdapter`** class.  It exports a function—often named `getGraphInstance()`—that lazily creates (or returns the already‑created) Graphology graph backed by LevelDB storage.  By exposing only this accessor, the module enforces the singleton contract: any import of the adapter receives the same graph reference, guaranteeing data consistency across the codebase.  The adapter also wires an automatic JSON export sync, which periodically serialises the in‑memory graph to a JSON file, enabling external tools (e.g., the RAG engine) to consume a snapshot without needing direct DB access.  

The **CodeGraph RAG** documentation does not contain executable code, but it describes a workflow where source files are parsed into AST nodes, each node becomes a vertex, and import/export relationships become edges.  Queries such as “find all functions that call X” are resolved by graph traversals, leveraging Graphology’s traversal APIs.  Because the graph is a singleton, the RAG module can safely perform read‑only traversals while other subsystems (e.g., the constraint monitor) may be mutating the graph in response to hook events.  

The **Copi CLI** wrapper, as outlined in `copi/USAGE.md`, likely implements a **factory** that maps command‑line flags to concrete handler classes (e.g., `StatusLineRenderer`, `GraphExporter`).  When a user invokes `copi status`, the factory instantiates the appropriate renderer, which may then be **decorated** by the status‑line extension described in `STATUS‑LINE‑QUICK‑REFERENCE.md`.  This layered construction keeps the core CLI thin while allowing optional features to be mixed in.  

The **constraint monitor** consumes hook payloads defined in `CLAUDE‑CODE‑HOOK‑FORMAT.md`.  A central dispatcher registers observers for hook types (e.g., `fileChanged`, `dependencyAdded`).  Each observer implements a specific **strategy** for validation (e.g., `NamingConventionStrategy`, `CircularDependencyStrategy`).  When a hook arrives, the dispatcher notifies all relevant observers, which then apply their strategy to the graph and emit diagnostics.  

Finally, the **builder‑style** configuration process in `claude‑code‑setup.md` likely constructs a `McpServerConfig` object by chaining setter methods (e.g., `.withPort(8080).withGraphPath("./graph.db")`).  This approach isolates complex configuration logic from the runtime code and makes the setup reproducible.

## Integration Points  

The singleton graph instance is the primary integration seam.  Every component that needs to read or write code‑level metadata imports `storage/graph-database-adapter.ts`.  Consequently, the **CodeGraph RAG** engine, the **Copi** status line, and the **ConstraintMonitor** all share a common data surface, enabling cross‑cutting concerns such as real‑time constraint validation during a RAG query.  

The **Copi CLI** interacts with the graph indirectly via its factory‑produced command objects.  For example, a `copi export` command may invoke a service that traverses the graph and writes a JSON dump, while a `copi status` command decorates the terminal status line with live graph metrics (node count, edge density).  This loose coupling is reinforced by the CLI’s reliance on interfaces defined in the `copi` package rather than concrete graph classes.  

The **ConstraintMonitor** registers observers that listen to hook events emitted by external tools (e.g., Claude code generation).  Those hooks are defined in `mcp‑constraint‑monitor/docs/CLAUDE‑CODE‑HOOK‑FORMAT.md` and are consumed by a dispatcher that updates the graph and runs strategy‑based checks.  This creates a feedback loop: a code change triggers a hook, the monitor validates constraints against the graph, and the result can be surfaced through the Copi status line or logged for the developer.  

Configuration flows from the **builder** described in `claude‑code‑setup.md` into the runtime.  The built `McpServerConfig` object is passed to the Graph‑Code MCP Server, which then initialises the `GraphDatabaseAdapter` with the appropriate persistence path and export settings.  This ensures that the singleton graph is bootstrapped consistently across environments (development, CI, production).

## Usage Guidelines  

1. **Always obtain the graph through the adapter’s accessor** (`getGraphInstance()`).  Direct instantiation of Graphology objects bypasses the singleton guarantee and can lead to divergent state.  
2. **Prefer the factory‑provided CLI commands** when interacting with the system from the terminal.  Adding a new command should be done by extending the factory map rather than editing the core CLI parser, preserving the open/closed principle.  
3. **When defining new hook types**, follow the JSON schema in `CLAUDE‑CODE‑HOOK‑FORMAT.md` and register a corresponding observer.  This keeps the observer chain coherent and avoids missed notifications.  
4. **Use the builder API** from `claude‑code‑setup.md` for any custom server configuration.  Supplying a partial configuration object can lead to undefined defaults; the builder ensures all required fields are populated before the server starts.  
5. **If extending the status line**, implement a decorator that wraps the base renderer.  This pattern allows multiple independent extensions (e.g., graph health, constraint violations) to coexist without modifying the original renderer.  

Adhering to these conventions aligns developers with the patterns already baked into the codebase, reduces friction when adding new features, and safeguards the consistency guarantees that the singleton graph provides.

### Architectural patterns identified  
* **Singleton** – `GraphDatabaseAdapter` guarantees one graph instance.  
* **Graph pattern** – Code entities modelled as vertices/edges (CodeGraph RAG).  
* **Factory** – Copi CLI creates command objects based on user input.  
* **Observer** – Hook dispatcher notifies constraint‑monitor observers.  
* **Builder** – Step‑wise configuration of the MCP server.  
* **Decorator** – Status‑line extensions augment existing UI components.  
* **Strategy** – Pluggable constraint validation policies.

### Design decisions and trade‑offs  
* **Centralised graph** simplifies consistency but creates a single point of contention; read‑heavy workloads are fine, but heavy writes may need batching or sharding.  
* **Singleton access** removes boiler‑plate but can hinder testing unless the adapter exposes a reset or mock injection point.  
* **Factory + decorator** keep the CLI lightweight and extensible, at the cost of slightly more indirection when tracing command flow.  
* **Observer pattern** decouples producers and consumers of hook events, but requires careful management of observer lifecycles to avoid memory leaks.  
* **Builder for configuration** yields clear, immutable config objects, though the chained API adds a learning curve for newcomers.

### System structure insights  
The system is organised around a **core data layer (graph)** surrounded by **feature modules** (RAG, CLI, constraint monitoring) that each consume the graph through well‑defined interfaces.  The sibling components—**CodingConventions**, **BestPractices**, **GraphDatabase**, **ConstraintMonitoring**—share the same underlying graph and therefore inherit its consistency guarantees.  The parent **CodingPatterns** component emphasizes data integrity, a goal reinforced by the singleton‑driven persistence strategy.

### Scalability considerations  
* **Horizontal scaling** can be achieved by partitioning the LevelDB store or migrating to a distributed graph store while preserving the singleton façade at the process level.  
* **Read scalability** benefits from the immutable nature of many graph traversals; caching of frequent sub‑graphs could be added without breaking existing patterns.  
* **Write scalability** may require queuing or batch updates to avoid contention on the singleton instance, especially when many constraint observers fire simultaneously.

### Maintainability assessment  
The heavy reliance on **well‑known design patterns** (singleton, factory, observer, etc.) makes the codebase approachable for developers familiar with classic OO architecture.  Documentation files explicitly name the patterns they employ, providing a living design ledger that reduces knowledge loss.  However, the **implicit nature** of some patterns (e.g., “may utilize the factory pattern”) means that developers must verify the actual implementation against the documentation, which could introduce drift.  Providing concrete unit tests that assert the presence of these patterns (e.g., checking that only one graph instance exists) would further strengthen maintainability.
