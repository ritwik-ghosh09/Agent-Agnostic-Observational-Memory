# MockServiceModule

**Type:** SubComponent

The MockServiceModule uses a validation mechanism to ensure mock responses conform to expected formats, as implemented in integrations/mcp-server-semantic-analysis/src/mock/llm-mock-validator.ts.

## What It Is  

The **MockServiceModule** is the concrete mock implementation of the `LLMService` interface that lives inside the *LLMAbstraction* hierarchy. All of its source files are located under the `integrations/mcp-server-semantic-analysis/src/mock/` directory:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `llm-mock-service.ts` | Exposes the mock service class that implements `LLMService`. |
| `llm-mock-config.ts` | Holds static configuration data that drives the mock responses. |
| `llm-mock-logger.ts` | Emits log entries whenever a mock response is generated, aiding debugging. |
| `llm-mock-randomizer.ts` | Introduces controlled randomness to vary the mock output. |
| `llm-mock-reset.ts` | Provides a public reset routine that clears any in‑memory mock state. |
| `llm-mock-validator.ts` | Checks that generated mock payloads conform to the expected schema before they are returned. |

Together these files give the system a fully‑featured, interchangeable LLM provider that can be swapped in place of a real LLM backend during development, testing, or when the production service is unavailable.

## Architecture and Design  

### Design patterns observed  

1. **Strategy / Provider pattern** – The broader `LLMAbstraction` component treats each concrete provider (e.g., `MockServiceModule`, `DMRProviderModule`) as a strategy that satisfies the `LLMService` contract defined in `lib/llm/llm-service.ts`. The `LLMServiceModule` resolves the current strategy via dependency injection, allowing the system to switch between real and mock providers at runtime.  

2. **Factory pattern** – The sibling `ProviderRegistryModule` (see `lib/llm/provider-registry-module.ts`) creates provider instances on demand. The registry knows about the `MockServiceModule` and can instantiate it when the configuration or mode resolution logic selects the mock mode.  

3. **Dependency Injection (DI)** – `LLMServiceModule` injects a concrete implementation of `LLMService` (mock or real) into consuming components. This decouples callers from the concrete class and makes the mock interchangeable without code changes.  

4. **Configuration‑driven behavior** – `llm-mock-config.ts` externalizes the static mock response data, making it easy to adjust the mock output without recompiling the service.  

5. **Cross‑cutting concerns via separate modules** – Logging (`llm-mock-logger.ts`), randomization (`llm-mock-randomizer.ts`), validation (`llm-mock-validator.ts`), and reset (`llm-mock-reset.ts`) are each encapsulated in their own files. This separation of concerns keeps the core mock service focused on response generation while still supporting observability, data integrity, and testability.  

### Interaction flow  

When a request arrives at the high‑level `LLMService` façade, the injected `getLLMMode` function (implemented in `llm-mock-service.ts`) determines whether the system should operate in *mock* mode. If so, the `ProviderRegistryModule` supplies an instance of `MockServiceModule`. The mock service then:

1. Reads the appropriate response template from `llm-mock-config.ts`.  
2. Passes the raw template through the **validator** (`llm-mock-validator.ts`) to ensure schema compliance.  
3. Optionally mutates the response using the **randomizer** (`llm-mock-randomizer.ts`) to add variability.  
4. Emits a **log entry** via `llm-mock-logger.ts`.  
5. Returns the final mock payload to the caller.  

If a test or developer needs a clean slate, they invoke the **reset** routine from `llm-mock-reset.ts`, which clears any cached or mutated mock data.

## Implementation Details  

### Core mock service (`llm-mock-service.ts`)  

The file exports a class (or object) that implements the methods declared in `lib/llm/llm-service.ts`. The implementation relies on a helper `getLLMMode` function that examines global configuration, per‑agent overrides, and legacy mock flags to decide whether the mock provider should be active. This function is the bridge between the parent `LLMAbstraction` and the mock module, ensuring that mode resolution is centralized.

### Configuration (`llm-mock-config.ts`)  

The configuration file contains a map of request signatures to static response payloads. Because it is a plain TypeScript module, developers can edit the JSON‑like structures directly, and the mock service reads them synchronously at runtime. This design keeps the mock data close to the code that consumes it, simplifying version control.

### Validation (`llm-mock-validator.ts`)  

Before a mock response is handed back, the validator checks required fields, data types, and any domain‑specific constraints. The validator is invoked early in the response pipeline, preventing malformed mock data from propagating to downstream components that expect the same contract as a real LLM response.

### Randomization (`llm-mock-randomizer.ts`)  

To avoid deterministic test results, the randomizer introduces variability (e.g., swapping synonyms, altering numeric scores) while still respecting the schema validated earlier. The randomness is deterministic per test run if a seed is supplied, which aids reproducibility.

### Logging (`llm-mock-logger.ts`)  

All mock response events are logged with a consistent format, including request identifiers, selected mock template, and any randomization applied. This aids developers in tracing why a particular mock output was produced, especially when multiple agents share the same mock configuration.

### Reset (`llm-mock-reset.ts`)  

The reset module exposes a function that clears any in‑memory caches or mutable state that the mock service may have built up (e.g., counters used for randomization). It is typically called in test setup/teardown hooks to guarantee isolation between test cases.

## Integration Points  

1. **Parent – LLMAbstraction** – The mock module fulfills the `LLMService` contract required by the abstraction layer. The parent component uses the `getLLMMode` function from `llm-mock-service.ts` to decide whether to route a request to the mock or a real provider.  

2. **Sibling – ProviderRegistryModule** – The registry (`lib/llm/provider-registry-module.ts`) knows how to instantiate `MockServiceModule`. It treats the mock as just another provider, applying the same factory logic it uses for `DMRProviderModule`.  

3. **Sibling – DMRProviderModule** – While the DMR provider talks to a Docker‑based Model Runner, the mock provider replaces that heavy runtime with lightweight in‑process logic. Both expose the same `LLMService` interface, allowing seamless swapping.  

4. **Sibling – LLMServiceModule** – This module performs dependency injection, wiring the chosen provider (mock or real) into downstream services. It also forwards the `reset` capability, enabling test harnesses to clear mock state without directly importing `llm-mock-reset.ts`.  

5. **External consumers** – Any component that calls `LLMService` (e.g., semantic analysis pipelines) receives either a real LLM response or a mock one, completely unaware of the underlying provider. The only required dependency is the `LLMService` interface, keeping the coupling minimal.

## Usage Guidelines  

* **Select the mock mode deliberately** – Use the `getLLMMode` logic (found in `llm-mock-service.ts`) to toggle mock behavior. Ensure that global configuration, per‑agent overrides, and legacy flags are set consistently across environments to avoid accidental production usage.  

* **Maintain the mock configuration** – When adding new request types or updating response schemas, edit `llm-mock-config.ts` and run the validator (`llm-mock-validator.ts`) to catch mismatches early. Treat this file as the single source of truth for mock data.  

* **Leverage the reset API** – In unit‑ or integration‑test suites, call the exported reset function from `llm-mock-reset.ts` before each test case to guarantee isolation. This prevents state bleed‑over from previous runs.  

* **Do not rely on randomness for critical assertions** – The randomizer (`llm-mock-randomizer.ts`) is useful for exercising variability, but tests that assert exact payload values should either disable randomization or fix the seed to produce deterministic output.  

* **Monitor mock logs** – The logger (`llm-mock-logger.ts`) writes detailed events. When debugging flaky tests, consult these logs to understand which mock template was selected and how it was altered.  

* **Stay aligned with the interface** – Any change to `LLMService` (in `lib/llm/llm-service.ts`) must be reflected in the mock implementation. The validator will surface mismatches, but developers should also update the mock class to keep the contract synchronized.

### Summary of Requested Items  

1. **Architectural patterns identified** – Strategy/Provider pattern for interchangeable LLM backends, Factory pattern in `ProviderRegistryModule`, Dependency Injection in `LLMServiceModule`, Configuration‑driven behavior, Separation of cross‑cutting concerns (logging, validation, randomization, reset).  

2. **Design decisions and trade‑offs** –  
   * *Decision*: Keep mock logic pure TypeScript with no external services, enabling fast local testing.  
   * *Trade‑off*: Mock responses may diverge from real LLM behavior; the validator mitigates schema drift but cannot emulate nuanced model quirks.  
   * *Decision*: Externalize mock data in `llm-mock-config.ts`.  
   * *Trade‑off*: Easier to edit but requires manual sync with any schema changes.  
   * *Decision*: Provide a randomizer for variability.  
   * *Trade‑off*: Adds nondeterminism; mitigated by optional seeding.  

3. **System structure insights** – The mock module lives as a child of `LLMAbstraction`, shares the `LLMService` contract with its siblings, and is instantiated via the `ProviderRegistryModule` factory. All supporting utilities (logger, validator, randomizer, reset) are modularized alongside the core mock service, reinforcing a clean separation of concerns.  

4. **Scalability considerations** – Because the mock runs entirely in‑process, it scales with the host application’s resources and does not introduce network latency. Adding new mock templates is a matter of extending `llm-mock-config.ts`, which scales linearly. The randomizer and validator are lightweight; however, very large mock data sets could increase memory usage, so developers should prune unused entries.  

5. **Maintainability assessment** – The clear file boundaries (service, config, logger, validator, randomizer, reset) promote high maintainability. The reliance on a single interface (`LLMService`) ensures that changes propagate uniformly. The only maintenance risk is drift between the mock configuration and the real LLM schema, which is mitigated by the validator and by keeping the config close to the service code.

## Hierarchy Context

### Parent
- [LLMAbstraction](./LLMAbstraction.md) -- The LLMAbstraction component utilizes a high-level facade, LLMService, which is defined in the file lib/llm/llm-service.ts. This facade is responsible for handling mode routing, caching, circuit breaking, budget/sensitivity checks, and provider fallback. The LLMService class employs dependency injection to set functions that resolve the current LLM mode, allowing for flexibility in determining the mode. For instance, the getLLMMode function in integrations/mcp-server-semantic-analysis/src/mock/llm-mock-service.ts is used to determine the LLM mode for a specific agent, considering global mode, per-agent overrides, and legacy mock flags.

### Siblings
- [ProviderRegistryModule](./ProviderRegistryModule.md) -- The ProviderRegistryModule uses a factory pattern in lib/llm/provider-registry-module.ts to create instances of different LLM providers, such as the DMRProviderModule and MockServiceModule.
- [DMRProviderModule](./DMRProviderModule.md) -- The DMRProviderModule uses a Docker API client to interact with the Model Runner, as seen in lib/llm/dmr-provider-module.ts.
- [LLMServiceModule](./LLMServiceModule.md) -- The LLMServiceModule uses a dependency injection mechanism to resolve the current LLM provider, as seen in lib/llm/llm-service.ts.
