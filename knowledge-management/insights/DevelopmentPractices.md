# DevelopmentPractices

**Type:** SubComponent

The integrations/copi/docs/SEND-VULNERABILITY-EMAILS.md file provides guidelines for sending vulnerability update emails, which is an example of a development practice

## What It Is  

The **DevelopmentPractices** sub‑component lives inside the `integrations/` tree and is realized through a collection of markdown‑based artefacts that capture concrete development‑level guidance. The primary artefacts are located at:  

* `integrations/copi/docs/hooks.md` – the authoritative **HookFunctionsReference** that enumerates every supported hook, its signature and usage patterns.  
* `integrations/mcp-constraint-monitor/docs/CLAUDE-CODE-HOOK-FORMAT.md` – the formal **hook data format** definition that all hook payloads must obey.  
* `integrations/copi/EXAMPLES.md` – a set of **hook usage examples** that illustrate real‑world invocation scenarios.  
* `integrations/copi/docs/SEND-VULNERABILITY-EMAILS.md`, `DELETE‑WORKSPACES‑README.md`, and `STATUS‑LINE‑QUICK‑REFERENCE.md` – concrete **development practice guides** that describe operational procedures (email notifications, workspace lifecycle, status‑line integration).  
* `integrations/code-graph-rag/README.md` – a concrete **graph‑based Retrieval‑Augmented Generation (RAG) practice** that demonstrates how a development team can embed a knowledge graph into their workflow.

Collectively, these files constitute a living handbook for developers working inside the **CodingPatterns** ecosystem. They are referenced by the parent component’s hook‑management runtime (see the `HookConfigLoader` in `lib/agent-api/hooks/hook-config.js`) and are consumed by sibling components such as **DesignPatterns** (which also relies on the same hook loading logic) and **CodingConventions** (which points developers to the usage guidelines in `integrations/copi/USAGE.md`).  

---

## Architecture and Design  

The architecture that emerges from the observations is a **modular hook‑centric design**. The parent component **CodingPatterns** supplies the runtime machinery (`HookConfigLoader`, `ensureLLMInitialized()` in `base-agent.ts`) that discovers, validates, and merges hook configurations at start‑up. This runtime expects hook definitions to conform to the **CLAUDE‑CODE‑HOOK‑FORMAT** documented in `integrations/mcp-constraint-monitor/docs/CLAUDE-CODE-HOOK-FORMAT.md`. By externalising the contract into a markdown file, the system decouples the static contract from the code that enforces it, enabling non‑code stakeholders (e.g., technical writers) to evolve the format without touching the loader logic.

The **DevelopmentPractices** sub‑component itself is a *knowledge‑artifact layer* that lives alongside the executable code. Its design follows a **documentation‑as‑code** pattern: each practice (e.g., “send vulnerability emails”) is captured in a dedicated markdown file under `integrations/copi/docs/`. The sibling **DesignPatterns** component re‑uses the same hook‑loading infrastructure, showing a **shared‑service** approach where multiple higher‑level concerns converge on a single hook configuration pipeline.

Interaction flow can be summarised as:

1. At agent start‑up, `HookConfigLoader` reads hook configuration files (JSON/YAML) that reference the hook identifiers described in `hooks.md`.  
2. The loader validates each payload against the schema defined in `CLAUDE-CODE-HOOK-FORMAT.md`.  
3. When a hook fires, the runtime dispatches to the implementation described in the examples (`EXAMPLES.md`).  
4. Ancillary practices (email alerts, workspace deletion, status‑line updates) are invoked by the same hook dispatcher, ensuring a **single‑point‑of‑orchestration** for operational side‑effects.

No additional architectural patterns (e.g., micro‑services, event‑sourcing) are mentioned, so the analysis stays within the documented hook‑centric modularity.

---

## Implementation Details  

Although the observations do not surface concrete source code for the DevelopmentPractices artefacts, they reveal the **implementation contract** that the runtime expects:

* **Hook Function Reference (`integrations/copi/docs/hooks.md`)** – lists each hook name (e.g., `onVulnerabilityFound`, `onWorkspaceDeleted`) together with required arguments, return type, and typical execution context. The file also provides short snippets that map directly to the example implementations in `integrations/copi/EXAMPLES.md`.

* **Hook Data Format (`integrations/mcp-constraint-monitor/docs/CLAUDE-CODE-HOOK-FORMAT.md`)** – specifies a JSON schema (fields like `hookId`, `payload`, `timestamp`, `metadata`). The schema is the authoritative source for validation performed by `HookConfigLoader`.

* **Example Implementations (`integrations/copi/EXAMPLES.md`)** – contain runnable pseudo‑code or script fragments that demonstrate how to read the payload, perform business logic, and optionally return a response. For instance, the “send vulnerability emails” practice shows a function that extracts vulnerability details from the payload, formats an email, and calls an internal mailer service.

* **Operational Guides** – each practice guide (e.g., `SEND-VULNERABILITY-EMAILS.md`) outlines pre‑conditions, required permissions, and side‑effects. They reference the same hook identifiers, ensuring that the hook dispatcher can trigger the correct procedural flow.

* **Graph‑Based RAG Example (`integrations/code-graph-rag/README.md`)** – illustrates a higher‑level practice where a hook is used to populate or query a knowledge graph. While not a code file, the README provides step‑by‑step instructions that developers can follow to integrate a graph‑RAG pipeline into their agents.

The **HookConfigLoader** class (mentioned in the parent component description) implements the following key responsibilities:

* **Discovery** – walks a configurable directory tree (e.g., `integrations/**/hooks/*.json`) to locate hook definition files.  
* **Merging** – combines multiple configuration sources (global defaults, project‑specific overrides) into a single in‑memory map.  
* **Validation** – applies the JSON schema from `CLAUDE-CODE-HOOK-FORMAT.md` to each entry, rejecting malformed hooks at start‑up.  
* **Lazy Execution** – works in concert with `ensureLLMInitialized()` to defer heavy LLM loading until a hook that requires it is actually invoked, preserving resources.

Because the DevelopmentPractices artefacts are pure markdown, the implementation relies on **runtime parsers** (e.g., a markdown front‑matter extractor) to turn human‑readable specifications into machine‑usable metadata.

## Integration Points  

The DevelopmentPractices sub‑component integrates at three logical layers:

1. **Runtime Hook Engine (Parent – CodingPatterns)**  
   * `HookConfigLoader` consumes the hook contract (`hooks.md`) and format (`CLAUDE-CODE-HOOK-FORMAT.md`).  
   * The engine exposes an API (`registerHook`, `triggerHook`) that the practice implementations call.

2. **Operational Services**  
   * Email delivery (used by `SEND-VULNERABILITY-EMAILS.md`) – the hook implementation calls an internal mailer service.  
   * Workspace management (used by `DELETE‑WORKSPACES‑README.md`) – the hook triggers a workspace‑lifecycle service.  
   * Status‑line rendering (referenced in `STATUS‑LINE‑QUICK‑REFERENCE.md`) – the hook pushes updates to a UI component that reads a shared state store.

3. **Higher‑Level Knowledge Systems**  
   * The graph‑based RAG practice (`code-graph-rag/README.md`) shows how a hook can feed data into a knowledge‑graph service, and later retrieve augmented responses. This demonstrates a **data‑pipeline integration** where hook payloads become part of a broader retrieval‑augmented workflow.

All integration points rely on the **shared hook identifier namespace** defined in the HookFunctionsReference, guaranteeing that disparate services can subscribe to the same events without duplication. The sibling component **DesignPatterns** also leverages this namespace, confirming a **cross‑component contract** that reduces coupling.

## Usage Guidelines  

Developers should treat the markdown artefacts as the **single source of truth** for any new or modified hook. When adding a hook:

1. **Define the contract** in `integrations/copi/docs/hooks.md`, following the existing syntax (name, arguments, description).  
2. **Add a schema entry** to the JSON schema described in `integrations/mcp-constraint-monitor/docs/CLAUDE-CODE-HOOK-FORMAT.md`. Keep the schema minimal to avoid validation overhead.  
3. **Provide an example** in `integrations/copi/EXAMPLES.md` that demonstrates a minimal, testable implementation.  
4. **Document the operational impact** in a dedicated guide (e.g., `SEND‑VULNERABILITY‑EMAILS.md`) if the hook triggers side‑effects such as external communications or resource cleanup.  
5. **Validate locally** by running the hook loader in a test harness; any schema violations will be reported before code is merged.  

When consuming an existing practice, follow the step‑by‑step instructions in the respective markdown guide. Ensure that any required service credentials (mail server, workspace manager) are provisioned in the environment before enabling the hook. Because the system lazily initializes heavy components (LLM models) via `ensureLLMInitialized()`, developers should avoid eager imports in hook implementations to preserve startup performance.

### Summary of Insights  

| Item | Insight |
|------|---------|
| **Architectural patterns identified** | Modular *hook‑centric* architecture; *documentation‑as‑code* for contracts; shared‑service contract across sibling components. |
| **Design decisions and trade‑offs** | Decoupling of hook schema (markdown) from runtime loader enables rapid evolution but adds a validation step at start‑up; lazy LLM initialization saves resources but requires developers to be aware of when heavy components are needed. |
| **System structure insights** | Parent **CodingPatterns** supplies the hook loader and lazy init logic; **DevelopmentPractices** provides the declarative reference and procedural guides; **HookFunctionsReference** (child) houses the definitive hook list; siblings (DesignPatterns, CodingConventions) reuse the same loader and reference the same markdown artefacts. |
| **Scalability considerations** | Because hook configurations are merged at start‑up, the system scales with the number of hooks as long as the schema remains lightweight. Lazy initialization prevents unnecessary memory pressure when many hooks exist but only a subset require heavy resources. |
| **Maintainability assessment** | High maintainability: all contracts live in readable markdown, allowing non‑engineers to update practices. Centralised validation via `HookConfigLoader` ensures consistency. The only risk is divergence between the markdown schema and actual code if updates are not synchronized, which is mitigated by the test harness that validates schemas on CI. |

These observations paint a clear picture of how **DevelopmentPractices** functions as the documented, hook‑driven best‑practice layer within the broader **CodingPatterns** ecosystem, fostering consistency, extensibility, and operational safety across the codebase.
