# PatternAnalysis

**Type:** SubComponent

PatternAnalysis can leverage the WaveController.runWithConcurrency() work-stealing approach via shared nextIndex counter to allow idle workers to pull tasks immediately, enhancing pattern analysis performance.

## What It Is  

**PatternAnalysis** is a sub‑component of the **CodingPatterns** domain that performs sophisticated searching, filtering, and validation of coding‑pattern data. The core logic lives alongside the graph‑storage layer – it calls the query API exposed by `storage/graph-database-adapter.ts` to retrieve pattern vertices and edges, then applies a series of rule‑based checks supplied by the **PatternManagement** sibling. The component also re‑uses runtime infrastructure that powers other analysis modules: the work‑stealing scheduler in `WaveController.runWithConcurrency()` and the DAG‑based execution engine borrowed from the **BatchScheduler** implementation. By pre‑populating ontology metadata through `PersistenceAgent.mapEntityToSharedMemory()`, PatternAnalysis avoids redundant large‑language‑model (LLM) classification passes, and it further validates results with the `ContentValidationAgent` found in `integrations/mcp‑server‑semantic‑analysis/src/agents/base-agent.ts`. In short, PatternAnalysis is the engine that turns raw pattern graphs into verified, high‑confidence insights for downstream consumers.

## Architecture and Design  

The architecture of PatternAnalysis is a composition of several proven internal patterns rather than a monolithic service. The **GraphDatabaseAdapter** acts as the persistence façade; PatternAnalysis invokes its `query` methods directly (see observation 1) to execute pattern‑search predicates. This decouples the analysis logic from the underlying Neo4j‑style graph store, allowing the same component to be reused across the sibling **PatternStorage** and **PatternManagement** modules.

Concurrency is handled with a **work‑stealing scheduler** (`WaveController.runWithConcurrency()`). A shared `nextIndex` counter lets idle workers pull the next unit of work without central coordination, which reduces contention and improves throughput when analyzing large pattern sets. The execution order follows a **DAG‑based topological sort** (observation 4), mirroring the approach used by the **BatchScheduler**. This ensures that pattern dependencies—e.g., a “factory” pattern that builds upon a “singleton” pattern—are respected, and that downstream validation steps only run after prerequisite analyses complete.

Validation is split into two complementary agents. **PatternManagement** supplies a static rule set that guarantees structural consistency, while the **ContentValidationAgent** (observation 6) performs runtime checks against the same rules, providing a double‑layer guard. Both agents consume the pre‑populated ontology metadata prepared by `PersistenceAgent.mapEntityToSharedMemory()` (observation 5), which eliminates the need for repeated LLM re‑classification and keeps the validation path lightweight.

## Implementation Details  

1. **Graph Access** – In `storage/graph-database-adapter.ts` the `query` method accepts Cypher‑like predicates. PatternAnalysis builds these predicates dynamically based on user‑supplied filters (e.g., pattern name, category, or relationship depth) and streams the result set to the analysis pipeline. No direct file‑system or ORM code is present; all persistence concerns are abstracted behind this adapter.

2. **Concurrency Engine** – `WaveController.runWithConcurrency()` implements a classic work‑stealing loop: a global `nextIndex` integer is atomically incremented; each worker thread reads the value, processes the corresponding pattern batch, and then loops back for the next index. This design avoids a master‑worker queue and scales well on multi‑core environments because idle threads immediately “steal” work rather than waiting for a dispatcher.

3. **DAG Execution** – The component builds a directed acyclic graph of pattern dependencies using metadata supplied by the `PersistenceAgent`. The DAG is topologically sorted before execution; each node (a pattern or a validation rule) is scheduled only after all its inbound edges have been satisfied. This mirrors the **BatchScheduler** logic and guarantees deterministic ordering without deadlocks.

4. **Metadata Pre‑Population** – `PersistenceAgent.mapEntityToSharedMemory()` walks the ontology at start‑up, extracts fields such as `patternType`, `complexityScore`, and `lastValidated`, and stores them in a shared in‑memory map. Subsequent analysis stages read from this map instead of invoking the LLM classifier again, which reduces latency and cost.

5. **Validation Agents** – The **PatternManagement** sub‑component exports a rule catalog (e.g., “must have at least one example usage”, “cannot reference deprecated patterns”). PatternAnalysis imports this catalog and runs each rule against the pattern graph. The **ContentValidationAgent** (found in `integrations/mcp‑server‑semantic‑analysis/src/agents/base-agent.ts`) implements the same rule interface but adds runtime checks like schema conformity and cross‑component consistency, feeding any violations back into the result payload.

## Integration Points  

PatternAnalysis sits at the intersection of storage, concurrency, and validation layers. Its primary external dependency is the **GraphDatabaseAdapter** (`storage/graph-database-adapter.ts`), which supplies all pattern data. It also relies on the **PatternManagement** sibling for rule definitions and on **PatternStorage** for any write‑back actions (e.g., persisting validation outcomes). The **PersistenceAgent** provides the in‑memory ontology cache that both the analysis engine and the **ContentValidationAgent** read from. Finally, the component is invoked by higher‑level services in the **CodingPatterns** parent—such as a UI‑driven “Explore Patterns” endpoint—that passes user filters and receives a validated pattern list. All these connections are mediated through clearly defined TypeScript interfaces (e.g., `IGraphQuery`, `IValidationRule`), ensuring loose coupling and easy substitution in tests.

## Usage Guidelines  

Developers should treat PatternAnalysis as a read‑heavy, compute‑intensive service. When adding new filters, extend the query builder in `storage/graph-database-adapter.ts` rather than hard‑coding Cypher strings; this keeps the abstraction consistent across siblings. New validation rules belong in the **PatternManagement** rule catalog; they automatically become part of the analysis pipeline without touching the core engine. If a new pattern type introduces additional metadata, update `PersistenceAgent.mapEntityToSharedMemory()` so the DAG builder can incorporate the new dependency edges.  

Because the work‑stealing scheduler scales with CPU cores, avoid spawning more workers than logical cores; the `runWithConcurrency()` API will cap the thread pool based on the `maxConcurrency` parameter. For large batch analyses, prefer chunk sizes that align with cache line boundaries (e.g., multiples of 64) to reduce false sharing on the `nextIndex` counter.  

When debugging, enable the verbose logging flag in `WaveController` to see which worker processed which index; the topological sort order can be inspected via the `DagExecutor.debugPrint()` helper (if present). Finally, always run the integration test suite that exercises the **ContentValidationAgent** against a known set of patterns to verify that rule changes do not introduce regressions.

### Architectural patterns identified  
* **Adapter pattern** – `GraphDatabaseAdapter` abstracts the graph store.  
* **Work‑stealing concurrency** – implemented in `WaveController.runWithConcurrency()`.  
* **DAG‑based execution with topological sort** – borrowed from the **BatchScheduler**.  
* **Cache‑aside / pre‑population** – `PersistenceAgent.mapEntityToSharedMemory()` caches ontology metadata.  
* **Rule‑engine validation** – separate static (`PatternManagement`) and runtime (`ContentValidationAgent`) rule sets.

### Design decisions and trade‑offs  
* **Decoupling storage via an adapter** improves testability but adds an indirection layer that must be kept in sync with any graph schema changes.  
* **Work‑stealing** yields high CPU utilisation for irregular workloads but requires careful atomic handling of the shared index to avoid contention.  
* **DAG execution** guarantees correct dependency ordering; however, building and sorting the DAG incurs upfront cost, which is acceptable because pattern graphs are relatively static.  
* **Pre‑populating ontology metadata** eliminates costly LLM calls at the expense of higher memory usage; this trade‑off is justified for the expected pattern volume.  
* **Dual‑layer validation** (static + runtime) provides robustness but introduces duplicated rule definitions; the shared rule interface mitigates maintenance overhead.

### System structure insights  
PatternAnalysis is a leaf node in the **CodingPatterns** hierarchy but acts as a hub for several cross‑cutting concerns: persistence, concurrency, and validation. Its reliance on sibling components (PatternManagement, PatternStorage) illustrates a modular design where each sibling owns a distinct responsibility (rule definition, storage) while sharing common infrastructure (graph adapter, scheduler).

### Scalability considerations  
* **Horizontal scalability** is limited by the single shared `nextIndex` counter; however, the atomic increment scales well up to dozens of cores. For massive workloads, sharding the pattern graph and running independent `WaveController` instances per shard would be a logical extension.  
* **Memory footprint** grows with the size of the ontology cache; monitoring the size of the map created by `PersistenceAgent` is essential for large enterprises.  
* **Query performance** depends on the GraphDatabaseAdapter’s underlying index strategy; adding appropriate graph indexes for frequently filtered fields (e.g., `patternName`, `category`) will keep query latency low as the pattern corpus expands.

### Maintainability assessment  
The component follows clear separation of concerns, making it relatively easy to maintain. The use of well‑named TypeScript interfaces and the adapter pattern localises changes to storage or validation logic. The most fragile area is the DAG construction; any change to the metadata schema must be reflected in the `mapEntityToSharedMemory` logic and the DAG builder, otherwise dependency ordering could break silently. Comprehensive unit tests around the scheduler, DAG executor, and validation agents are therefore critical to preserve reliability as the codebase evolves.

## Hierarchy Context

### Parent
- [CodingPatterns](./CodingPatterns.md) -- The CodingPatterns component utilizes the GraphDatabaseAdapter, as seen in storage/graph-database-adapter.ts, to store and manage design patterns, best practices, and coding conventions. This is evident in the way it employs the storePattern method of the GraphDatabaseAdapter to save new patterns, similar to the CodeAnalysis, AntiPatterns, BestPractices, and CodingConventions components. For instance, in the ContentValidationAgent, located in integrations/mcp-server-semantic-analysis/src/agents/base-agent.ts, the GraphDatabaseAdapter is used to store and retrieve validation patterns.

### Siblings
- [PatternManagement](./PatternManagement.md) -- PatternManagement uses the storePattern method of the GraphDatabaseAdapter to save new patterns, similar to the CodeAnalysis, AntiPatterns, BestPractices, and CodingConventions components.
- [PatternStorage](./PatternStorage.md) -- PatternStorage uses the GraphDatabaseAdapter to store and manage design patterns, best practices, and coding conventions.
