# CodeKnowledgeGraph

**Type:** SubComponent

The CodeKnowledgeGraph sub-component is crucial for the KnowledgeManagement component as it provides a centralized solution for code knowledge management.

## What It Is  

**CodeKnowledgeGraph** is the sub‑component responsible for building, storing, and querying a *code‑centric* knowledge graph that captures AST‑derived entities and their relationships. The core logic lives in the **CodeGraphAgent** located at `src/agents/code-graph-agent.ts`. This agent parses source code into an abstract syntax tree (AST), extracts semantic entities (e.g., classes, functions, modules) and links them together, exposing an interface that downstream modules can use for “semantic code search”. The graph itself is persisted through the **GraphDatabaseAdapter** (`storage/graph-database-adapter.ts`) which guarantees data consistency and integrity, while the **EntityPersistence** sub‑component handles the lifecycle (create, update, delete) of individual graph nodes and edges. CodeKnowledgeGraph sits inside the larger **KnowledgeManagement** component, which treats it as the authoritative source of code‑related knowledge for the whole system.

## Architecture and Design  

The observed structure reveals a **layered architecture** built around a *graph‑database‑backed* storage layer. The **GraphDatabaseAdapter** acts as an **Adapter** that abstracts the underlying graph store (Graphology + LevelDB) from the business logic. All sibling components—**ManualLearning**, **OnlineLearning**, **EntityPersistence**, **GraphDatabaseStorage**, and **UKBTraceReporting**—also depend on this adapter, indicating a shared persistence contract across the KnowledgeManagement domain.

The **CodeGraphAgent** functions as an **Agent/Facade** that encapsulates two distinct responsibilities: (1) AST parsing and entity extraction, and (2) exposing query operations for semantic search. By keeping these responsibilities together, the design avoids scattering parsing logic throughout the code base and provides a single, well‑defined entry point for any consumer that needs code‑level insight.

The **EntityPersistence** sub‑component is a dedicated **CRUD service** for graph entities. It is invoked by CodeKnowledgeGraph whenever a new code entity is discovered, an existing one is modified (e.g., after a refactor), or an entity is removed. This separation of concerns isolates persistence mechanics from the higher‑level graph construction performed by the CodeGraphAgent.

Overall, the system follows a **dependency‑injection‑friendly** style: the higher‑level KnowledgeManagement component composes its children (CodeKnowledgeGraph, ManualLearning, etc.) by providing each with the same GraphDatabaseAdapter instance, ensuring consistent transaction semantics and simplifying testing.

## Implementation Details  

* **`src/agents/code-graph-agent.ts`** – The primary class (likely `CodeGraphAgent`) implements methods such as `parseAST(source: string): ASTNode[]`, `extractEntities(ast: ASTNode[]): CodeEntity[]`, and `searchSemantic(query: string): CodeEntity[]`. Internally it invokes a parser (e.g., TypeScript’s compiler API) to produce an AST, walks the tree to identify entities, and then translates those entities into graph nodes using the GraphDatabaseAdapter’s API.

* **GraphDatabaseAdapter (`storage/graph-database-adapter.ts`)** – Provides low‑level operations like `addNode(node)`, `addEdge(sourceId, targetId, type)`, `updateNode(node)`, `removeNode(id)`, and query helpers. Because every sibling component uses the same adapter, it likely wraps Graphology’s API and LevelDB persistence, exposing a consistent TypeScript interface.

* **EntityPersistence** – Though the exact file path isn’t listed, it is referenced as a sub‑component that “manages entity creation, updates, and deletion”. It probably offers higher‑level methods such as `createEntity(metadata)`, `updateEntity(id, changes)`, and `deleteEntity(id)`. These methods call through to the GraphDatabaseAdapter, ensuring that any graph mutation respects transactional rules enforced by the adapter.

* **Interaction Flow** – When new source code is fed into the system (e.g., via a Git hook or batch pipeline), KnowledgeManagement triggers the CodeGraphAgent. The agent parses the code, builds a set of `CodeEntity` objects, and hands them to EntityPersistence, which persists them using the GraphDatabaseAdapter. Queries from other components (e.g., a semantic search UI) are routed back through the CodeGraphAgent, which translates the request into graph‑database queries via the adapter.

---

## Integration Points  

* **Parent – KnowledgeManagement** – The parent component orchestrates the lifecycle of CodeKnowledgeGraph. It supplies the shared `GraphDatabaseAdapter` instance and may coordinate with other siblings (e.g., `OnlineLearning` for batch extraction or `ManualLearning` for curated edits) to keep the graph up‑to‑date.

* **Siblings – ManualLearning, OnlineLearning, EntityPersistence, GraphDatabaseStorage, UKUTraceReporting** – All share the same persistence contract (`GraphDatabaseAdapter`). For example, `ManualLearning` can directly insert manually curated entities into the graph, while `OnlineLearning` can feed batch‑extracted entities that later become part of the CodeKnowledgeGraph. `EntityPersistence` is both a sibling and a child service used by CodeKnowledgeGraph, highlighting a reuse pattern.

* **External Consumers** – Any component that needs to perform “semantic code search” or retrieve code metadata will call the public interface of `CodeGraphAgent`. Because the agent abstracts away the underlying graph queries, consumers remain insulated from storage details.

* **Storage Layer** – The concrete storage implementation lives in `storage/graph-database-adapter.ts`, which in turn relies on Graphology (an in‑memory graph library) backed by LevelDB for durability. This adapter is the sole gateway to persistent state, making it a critical integration point for data integrity.

## Usage Guidelines  

1. **Always go through the CodeGraphAgent** when you need to add, update, or query code entities. Direct interaction with the GraphDatabaseAdapter should be limited to infrastructure code (e.g., migrations) to preserve encapsulation.  
2. **Leverage EntityPersistence** for any CRUD operation on graph nodes. This ensures that all mutations pass through the same validation and consistency checks implemented in the adapter.  
3. **Keep AST parsing isolated** to the agent; avoid re‑implementing parsing logic in sibling components. If you need a custom AST transformation, extend the agent rather than duplicating code.  
4. **Coordinate with KnowledgeManagement** when initializing or tearing down the graph. The parent component may perform global transactions (e.g., bulk imports from OnlineLearning) that require the graph to be in a known state.  
5. **Respect the shared GraphDatabaseAdapter** contract. If you need to change the underlying storage (e.g., switch from LevelDB to another backend), you only need to modify the adapter implementation; all dependent components, including CodeKnowledgeGraph, will continue to function unchanged.

### Architectural Patterns Identified  

| Pattern | Where It Appears |
|---------|-------------------|
| **Adapter** | `GraphDatabaseAdapter` abstracts Graphology + LevelDB storage. |
| **Agent / Facade** | `CodeGraphAgent` provides a unified interface for AST parsing and semantic search. |
| **CRUD Service** | `EntityPersistence` encapsulates create/update/delete operations for graph entities. |
| **Layered Architecture** | KnowledgeManagement (top layer) → CodeKnowledgeGraph (domain layer) → GraphDatabaseAdapter (infrastructure layer). |
| **Dependency Injection** | Shared `GraphDatabaseAdapter` instance injected into all sibling components. |

### Design Decisions & Trade‑offs  

* **Single Source of Persistence** – Using one adapter simplifies consistency but creates a single point of failure; any bug in the adapter propagates to all components.  
* **Agent‑Centric Parsing** – Centralising AST work in `CodeGraphAgent` reduces duplication but can become a bottleneck if parsing large codebases concurrently; scaling may require sharding the agent’s workload.  
* **Explicit EntityPersistence Layer** – Adds an extra indirection that improves testability and separation of concerns, at the cost of slightly more boilerplate for each CRUD operation.  
* **Graph‑Database Choice (Graphology + LevelDB)** – Provides fast in‑memory graph operations with durable backing, but LevelDB’s single‑process model may limit horizontal scaling without additional sharding logic.

### System Structure Insights  

The system is organized around a **knowledge graph core** that is accessed uniformly by a suite of sibling services. All knowledge‑related persistence funnels through the same adapter, creating a tightly coupled but well‑defined data contract. The hierarchy (KnowledgeManagement → CodeKnowledgeGraph → CodeGraphAgent → EntityPersistence → GraphDatabaseAdapter) demonstrates clear responsibility boundaries: orchestration, domain logic, parsing/semantic services, CRUD, and storage.

### Scalability Considerations  

* **Parsing Parallelism** – To handle large repositories, multiple instances of `CodeGraphAgent` could be spawned, each processing a subset of files and writing to the shared graph via the adapter. The adapter must therefore support concurrent writes (LevelDB provides atomic batch writes, but contention may need to be managed).  
* **Graph Size** – As the number of code entities grows, in‑memory Graphology may consume significant RAM. Introducing pagination or on‑demand loading strategies in the adapter could mitigate memory pressure.  
* **Read‑Heavy Workloads** – Semantic search queries are read‑only; caching frequently used query results at the agent level could improve latency without altering the underlying storage.

### Maintainability Assessment  

The clear separation between **parsing (CodeGraphAgent)**, **persistence (EntityPersistence)**, and **storage (GraphDatabaseAdapter)** yields high modularity, making unit testing straightforward. Because all siblings share the same adapter, any change to persistence semantics is localized to a single file (`graph-database-adapter.ts`). However, this tight coupling also means that extensive changes to the storage backend require coordinated updates across many components. Documentation of the adapter’s contract and versioned interfaces will be essential to preserve maintainability as the system evolves.

## Hierarchy Context

### Parent
- [KnowledgeManagement](./KnowledgeManagement.md) -- [LLM] The KnowledgeManagement component utilizes the GraphDatabaseAdapter (storage/graph-database-adapter.ts) for efficient data storage and retrieval in the Graphology + LevelDB knowledge graph. This adapter enables the component to handle data persistence, graph database storage, and query capabilities seamlessly. For instance, the PersistenceAgent (src/agents/persistence-agent.ts) leverages the GraphDatabaseAdapter to store and retrieve entities from the graph database, demonstrating a clear example of how the component's architecture supports data management. Furthermore, the CodeGraphAgent (src/agents/code-graph-agent.ts) uses the GraphDatabaseAdapter to construct the AST-based code knowledge graph, facilitating semantic code search capabilities.

### Siblings
- [ManualLearning](./ManualLearning.md) -- ManualLearning utilizes the GraphDatabaseAdapter (storage/graph-database-adapter.ts) to store and retrieve manually curated entities.
- [OnlineLearning](./OnlineLearning.md) -- OnlineLearning leverages the batch analysis pipeline to extract knowledge from git history and LSL sessions.
- [EntityPersistence](./EntityPersistence.md) -- EntityPersistence utilizes the GraphDatabaseAdapter (storage/graph-database-adapter.ts) to store and retrieve entities.
- [GraphDatabaseStorage](./GraphDatabaseStorage.md) -- GraphDatabaseStorage utilizes the GraphDatabaseAdapter (storage/graph-database-adapter.ts) to store and retrieve graph data.
- [UKBTraceReporting](./UKBTraceReporting.md) -- UKBTraceReporting utilizes the GraphDatabaseAdapter (storage/graph-database-adapter.ts) to store and retrieve workflow run data.
