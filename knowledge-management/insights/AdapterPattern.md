# AdapterPattern

**Type:** SubComponent

The SpecstoryAdapter class in lib/integrations/specstory-adapter.js employs connection methods in order of preference, starting with HTTP, then IPC, and finally file watch, as seen in the connectViaHTTP, connectViaIPC, and connectViaFileWatch methods.

## What It Is  

The **AdapterPattern** sub‑component lives inside the **Trajectory** component and is concretely realized by the `SpecstoryAdapter` class located at `lib/integrations/specstory‑adapter.js`.  This class implements a classic *Adapter* – it translates the generic logging contract expected by the Trajectory subsystem into the concrete protocol required by the external **Specstory** service.  The adapter exposes a single, stable interface to the rest of the system while internally juggling three distinct connection strategies: HTTP, Inter‑Process Communication (IPC), and file‑system watching.  The ordering of these strategies (HTTP → IPC → file watch) is encoded in the methods `connectViaHTTP`, `connectViaIPC`, and `connectViaFileWatch`, respectively.  By encapsulating all of the “how do we talk to Specstory?” details, the AdapterPattern enables the Trajectory component to log conversations without needing to know anything about the underlying transport mechanism.

## Architecture and Design  

The design follows the **Adapter pattern** explicitly (observations 1, 6, 7).  `SpecstoryAdapter` acts as a façade that conforms to the logging interface required by **Trajectory** while delegating the actual communication to one of three concrete strategies.  This is a textbook example of *Strategy* embedded within an Adapter: the three `connectVia*` methods represent interchangeable algorithms selected at runtime based on availability.  

The component hierarchy shows **Trajectory** as the parent, which *contains* the AdapterPattern.  The AdapterPattern, in turn, *contains* a **ConnectionManager** child that houses the three connection methods.  Sibling components such as **SpecstoryLogger** also depend on the same adapter, reinforcing a shared‑service model.  The presence of siblings like **ConcurrencyManager** and **LLMInitializer** indicates that the overall system is modular, with each concern isolated behind a well‑defined interface.  No cross‑cutting coupling is observed beyond the adapter’s public contract, which keeps the architecture clean and promotes independent evolution of each sibling.

## Implementation Details  

`SpecstoryAdapter` is defined in `lib/integrations/specstory‑adapter.js`.  Its core responsibility is to expose a unified logging API to **Trajectory** while internally attempting to establish a connection using the most efficient channel first.  

* **`connectViaHTTP`** – Issues standard HTTP requests to the Specstory endpoint.  The observation notes that this method “provides a reliable and efficient means of communication,” implying that it likely uses a lightweight HTTP client (e.g., `fetch` or `axios`) and handles typical response codes, retries, and time‑outs.  

* **`connectViaIPC`** – Falls back to an Inter‑Process Communication mechanism when HTTP is unavailable.  While the exact IPC technology is not spelled out, the method’s existence signals that the adapter can communicate with a locally running Specstory daemon, perhaps via Unix domain sockets or Node’s `process.send`/`process.on` channels.  

* **`connectViaFileWatch`** – Acts as the last‑resort fallback, watching a predefined file or directory for changes (e.g., using `fs.watch`).  When the file is updated, the adapter interprets the change as a signal from Specstory and proceeds to log the conversation.  This method guarantees that logging continues even in highly constrained environments where network or IPC are blocked.  

The **ConnectionManager** child aggregates these three methods, likely exposing a `connect()` wrapper that sequentially attempts each strategy until one succeeds.  Because the ordering is hard‑coded (HTTP → IPC → file watch), the system automatically prefers the most performant path without requiring external configuration.

## Integration Points  

* **Trajectory (parent)** – Calls into the AdapterPattern to log conversation data.  The parent expects a stable interface (e.g., `logConversation(payload)`) that `SpecstoryAdapter` satisfies.  This relationship is explicitly mentioned in the hierarchy context.  

* **SpecstoryLogger (sibling)** – Also consumes `SpecstoryAdapter`.  Both the logger and Trajectory share the same adapter instance, ensuring consistent handling of connection failures and fallback logic across the system.  

* **ConnectionManager (child)** – Encapsulates the low‑level connection logic.  Any future integration that needs a new transport (e.g., WebSocket) would be added here without touching Trajectory or the logger.  

* **External Specstory service** – The ultimate target of the communication.  The adapter abstracts away whether Specstory is reachable via HTTP, a local IPC endpoint, or a file‑based protocol, allowing the rest of the codebase to remain agnostic of these details.  

No other internal modules are referenced in the observations, so the adapter’s dependencies appear limited to standard Node.js networking/file APIs and possibly a lightweight HTTP client library.

## Usage Guidelines  

1. **Prefer the default adapter** – When logging from Trajectory or SpecstoryLogger, instantiate `SpecstoryAdapter` directly; the internal ordering of connection strategies ensures the optimal path is chosen automatically.  
2. **Do not bypass the adapter** – Directly invoking HTTP, IPC, or file‑watch logic outside the adapter defeats the purpose of the pattern and introduces duplicated connection handling.  
3. **Handle asynchronous initialization** – Since the connection attempt may involve network I/O or file‑system watchers, callers should await the adapter’s `connect()` promise (or equivalent) before sending the first log entry.  
4. **Extend carefully** – Adding a new transport (e.g., WebSocket) should be done inside the **ConnectionManager** child as a new `connectViaWebSocket` method and then referenced in the sequential fallback chain.  No changes to Trajectory or SpecstoryLogger are required.  
5. **Monitor fallback usage** – For observability, log which connection method succeeded.  This information can guide future infrastructure decisions (e.g., if file‑watch fallback is used frequently, it may indicate network restrictions that need remediation).

### 1. Architectural patterns identified  
* **Adapter Pattern** – `SpecstoryAdapter` translates the generic logging contract into Specstory‑specific calls.  
* **Strategy (within Adapter)** – The three `connectVia*` methods act as interchangeable connection algorithms.  

### 2. Design decisions and trade‑offs  
* **Preference ordering (HTTP → IPC → file watch)** – Maximizes performance and reliability but adds complexity in the fallback logic.  
* **Single responsibility** – Adapter focuses on protocol translation; ConnectionManager isolates low‑level transport details, improving testability.  
* **Extensibility vs. simplicity** – Adding new transports is straightforward (extend ConnectionManager) but requires careful ordering to avoid unintended preference changes.  

### 3. System structure insights  
* **Hierarchical composition** – Trajectory → AdapterPattern → ConnectionManager creates a clear vertical slice of responsibility.  
* **Sibling reuse** – Both SpecstoryLogger and Trajectory share the same adapter, reinforcing a DRY approach.  
* **Loose coupling** – Trajectory interacts only with the adapter’s stable interface; it is unaware of the underlying transport mechanisms.  

### 4. Scalability considerations  
* **Connection pooling** – HTTP connections could be reused across many log calls; the current design does not specify pooling, so future work may add a shared HTTP agent.  
* **Concurrent logging** – Since the adapter abstracts transport, multiple concurrent log requests can be serialized or parallelized without affecting the calling components.  
* **Fallback latency** – In large‑scale deployments, reliance on the slower file‑watch fallback could become a bottleneck; monitoring fallback frequency is essential.  

### 5. Maintainability assessment  
* **High** – The clear separation of concerns (Adapter vs. ConnectionManager) makes the codebase easy to understand and modify.  
* **Extensible** – New integrations require only additions to ConnectionManager, preserving existing contracts.  
* **Potential risk** – The hard‑coded ordering of connection strategies could become a maintenance burden if the environment’s preferred transport changes; exposing the order via configuration would mitigate this.

### Parent
- [Trajectory](./Trajectory.md) -- [LLM] The Trajectory component utilizes the SpecstoryAdapter in lib/integrations/specstory-adapter.js for logging conversations via Specstory, demonstrating an adapter pattern for integration with different tools and services. This adapter pattern allows for a standardized interface to interact with various extensions, such as Specstory, facilitating the addition of new integrations with minimal modifications to the existing codebase. The SpecstoryAdapter class, specifically, employs connection methods in order of preference, starting with HTTP, then IPC, and finally file watch, as seen in the connectViaHTTP, connectViaIPC, and connectViaFileWatch methods. This approach ensures that the most efficient and reliable connection method is used, while providing fallback options in case of failures.

### Children
- [ConnectionManager](./ConnectionManager.md) -- The connectViaHTTP, connectViaIPC, and connectViaFileWatch methods in the SpecstoryAdapter class (lib/integrations/specstory-adapter.js) implement the connection logic in order of preference.

### Siblings
