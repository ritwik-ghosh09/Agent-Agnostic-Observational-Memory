# ServiceMonitor

**Type:** SubComponent

The ServiceMonitor sub-component contributes to the overall reliability of the DockerizedServices component by ensuring that services remain healthy and responsive.

## What It Is  

The **ServiceMonitor** sub‑component lives inside the **DockerizedServices** component and is implemented by leveraging the `isPortListening` function that resides in `lib/service-starter.js`.  Its primary responsibility is to continuously poll the TCP ports of the services that Docker‑compose brings up (e.g., Memgraph, Redis) and to verify that each service remains responsive after it has been started.  When a service stops responding, ServiceMonitor detects the failure and immediately triggers the retry logic that is also defined in `lib/service-starter.js`.  In this way, ServiceMonitor acts as the runtime health‑checking guard that keeps the DockerizedServices ecosystem reliable and self‑healing.

## Architecture and Design  

ServiceMonitor follows a **health‑check‑loop** architectural approach.  The component repeatedly calls the shared `isPortListening` utility, which performs a low‑level socket connection test to confirm that a service’s port is open and accepting traffic.  This loop is encapsulated in the **StatusChecker** child component, allowing the monitoring logic to be isolated from higher‑level orchestration concerns.  

The design re‑uses the **retry‑with‑backoff** pattern already present in the sibling **ServiceStarter** component.  When ServiceMonitor discovers an unresponsive service, it does not simply restart the container; instead, it invokes the same `startServiceWithRetry` routine (also defined in `lib/service-starter.js`).  This routine attempts to bring the service back up multiple times, increasing the delay between attempts to avoid rapid, repeated failures.  By sharing the retry implementation, DockerizedServices achieves a consistent error‑recovery strategy across both startup and runtime phases.  

The interaction model is essentially **pull‑based monitoring**: ServiceMonitor pulls status information via `isPortListening` rather than relying on push notifications from the services themselves.  This choice simplifies the contract between ServiceMonitor and the services it watches, at the cost of periodic network traffic.

## Implementation Details  

The core of ServiceMonitor’s operation is the `isPortListening` function in `lib/service-starter.js`.  This function attempts a TCP connection to a given host/port pair and returns a boolean indicating whether the connection succeeded.  ServiceMonitor’s **StatusChecker** repeatedly invokes this function on a configurable interval (the interval is not explicitly documented in the observations but is implied by the “continuously check” phrasing).  

When `isPortListening` returns `false`, ServiceMonitor interprets the result as a service failure.  It then delegates to the `startServiceWithRetry` function—also located in `lib/service-starter.js`—which implements a **retry‑with‑backoff** algorithm.  The backoff logic typically starts with a short delay and exponentially increases the wait time after each unsuccessful attempt, capping the number of retries to prevent indefinite loops.  By re‑using this function, ServiceMonitor avoids duplicating retry logic and ensures that both startup and runtime recovery follow identical policies.  

The hierarchical relationship is explicit: **DockerizedServices** (parent) provides the overall container orchestration, **ServiceStarter** (sibling) supplies the startup and retry utilities, **ServiceMonitor** (current component) performs ongoing health verification, and **StatusChecker** (child) encapsulates the polling mechanism.  All three share the same `lib/service-starter.js` utilities, reinforcing a single source of truth for service health logic.

## Integration Points  

ServiceMonitor is tightly coupled to the `lib/service-starter.js` module.  It reads the port configuration of each Dockerized service—likely supplied by the Docker compose definition or environment variables—and passes those values to `isPortListening`.  Upon detecting a failure, it calls back into `startServiceWithRetry`, which in turn may interact with Docker APIs or container orchestration scripts to restart the offending container.  

Because ServiceMonitor lives within **DockerizedServices**, its lifecycle is bound to the parent component’s initialization sequence.  The parent component typically starts all containers, then hands control to ServiceMonitor to ensure they stay healthy.  The sibling **ServiceStarter** provides the shared retry implementation, so any changes to the backoff algorithm automatically affect both startup and runtime recovery.  The child **StatusChecker** offers a clear extension point: if a future requirement demands a different probing method (e.g., HTTP health endpoints), developers can replace or augment StatusChecker without touching ServiceMonitor’s higher‑level logic.

## Usage Guidelines  

1. **Do not modify `isPortListening` directly** unless you also update the corresponding calls in ServiceMonitor and ServiceStarter.  The function is the single point of truth for port‑level health checks.  
2. **Configure polling intervals thoughtfully**.  Although the observations do not specify the interval, a too‑frequent check can add unnecessary network load, while a too‑sparse interval may delay failure detection.  Align the interval with the expected responsiveness of the services you monitor.  
3. **Rely on the built‑in retry‑with‑backoff** by invoking `startServiceWithRetry` rather than implementing ad‑hoc restart logic.  This ensures consistent backoff behavior across the system and prevents rapid restart storms.  
4. **Keep StatusChecker focused on probing**.  If you need additional diagnostics (e.g., logging response payloads), extend StatusChecker rather than embedding that logic inside ServiceMonitor.  This preserves the clean separation between “monitoring” and “orchestration.”  
5. **Test failure scenarios in isolation**.  Simulate a port being closed and verify that ServiceMonitor correctly triggers the retry path.  This helps guarantee that the health‑check loop and retry mechanism remain in sync after future code changes.

### Architectural patterns identified  
* **Health‑check loop** (periodic `isPortListening` polling)  
* **Retry‑with‑backoff** (shared via `startServiceWithRetry`)  

### Design decisions and trade‑offs  
* **Pull‑based monitoring** simplifies contracts but incurs periodic network traffic.  
* **Centralising health logic in `lib/service-starter.js`** reduces duplication but creates a tight coupling between monitoring and startup code.  
* **Using a single backoff implementation** ensures consistency but limits flexibility if different services require distinct retry policies.  

### System structure insights  
* **DockerizedServices** is the parent orchestrator; **ServiceMonitor** provides runtime health assurance; **ServiceStarter** supplies startup and retry utilities; **StatusChecker** isolates the polling mechanism.  
* All health‑related utilities converge on `lib/service-starter.js`, establishing a clear “utility hub” for service reliability.  

### Scalability considerations  
* The health‑check loop scales linearly with the number of services—each additional service adds another periodic port probe.  
* Excessive polling frequency can strain network resources in large deployments; tuning intervals and possibly batching checks become important as the service count grows.  

### Maintainability assessment  
* High maintainability thanks to **single‑source health functions** (`isPortListening`, `startServiceWithRetry`).  
* Clear separation of concerns (StatusChecker vs. ServiceMonitor) aids future extensions.  
* Tight coupling to a specific file (`lib/service-starter.js`) means changes to that file must be reviewed system‑wide, but the benefit is reduced code duplication and uniform behavior.

## Hierarchy Context

### Parent
- [DockerizedServices](./DockerizedServices.md) -- The DockerizedServices component employs a robust service startup mechanism through the startServiceWithRetry function in lib/service-starter.js, which utilizes a retry-with-backoff pattern to handle service startup failures. This approach ensures that services are given multiple opportunities to start successfully, with increasing time delays between attempts, thereby preventing rapid sequential failures. The isPortListening function within the same file performs health verification checks to confirm that services are responding correctly, adding an extra layer of reliability to the startup process. For instance, when starting Memgraph or Redis services, this mechanism ensures they are properly initialized and ready to accept requests before proceeding with the application startup.

### Children
- [StatusChecker](./StatusChecker.md) -- The ServiceMonitor sub-component uses the isPortListening function in lib/service-starter.js to continuously check the services' status, implying a periodic checking mechanism.

### Siblings
- [ServiceStarter](./ServiceStarter.md) -- The startServiceWithRetry function in lib/service-starter.js uses a retry-with-backoff pattern to handle service startup failures, preventing rapid sequential failures.
