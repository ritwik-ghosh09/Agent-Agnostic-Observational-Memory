# DashboardRouter

**Type:** Detail

The lack of specific code files in the source files section implies that the DashboardRouter may be a crucial component in the parent context.

## What It Is  

**DashboardRouter** is the routing component that underpins the web‑based dashboard used by the **MCP Constraint Monitor**. The only concrete artefacts that mention it live in the `integrations/mcp-constraint-monitor/dashboard/README.md` file, which describes a “dashboard routing mechanism”, and the higher‑level `integrations/mcp-constraint-monitor/README.md` that introduces the MCP Constraint Monitor itself. The hierarchical context tells us that **DashboardRouter** is owned by **DashboardService** (“DashboardService contains DashboardRouter”). No source files containing concrete class or function definitions are listed in the observations, so the router’s implementation details are not directly visible, but its purpose can be inferred: it maps incoming HTTP (or internal) requests to the appropriate dashboard handlers, enabling users to start, view, and manage constraint‑monitoring activities from a single UI surface.

## Architecture and Design  

From the limited evidence, the architecture follows a classic **service‑oriented composition** where a higher‑level service (**DashboardService**) aggregates a routing sub‑component (**DashboardRouter**) to expose UI endpoints. The presence of a dedicated `dashboard/README.md` suggests a **router‑centric design**: the router is likely the single entry point for all dashboard‑related routes, centralising URL‑to‑handler mappings.  

The design appears to adopt the **Router (or Front Controller) pattern**, common in web applications, where a router receives a request, determines the appropriate controller/action, and forwards the request. This pattern simplifies the addition of new dashboard pages because developers only need to register a new route with the router rather than modify multiple dispatch points.  

Because the router lives inside **DashboardService**, it is reasonable to assume a **tight coupling** between routing logic and the service’s business logic (e.g., fetching constraint‑monitor data, triggering start‑up sequences). This coupling can be advantageous for performance—routing decisions can directly invoke service methods without an extra network hop—but it also means that changes to routing semantics may ripple into the service layer.

## Implementation Details  

The observations do not expose concrete symbols, so the following implementation sketch is derived strictly from the naming and hierarchy:

1. **Class / Component Name** – `DashboardRouter` is likely a class or module instantiated by **DashboardService** during its initialization phase.  
2. **Route Registration** – The router probably exposes a method such as `registerRoute(path, handler)` that is called from the `dashboard/README.md` documentation to describe which UI pages are available (e.g., `/constraints`, `/status`, `/settings`).  
3. **Handler Delegation** – Each route handler is expected to be a thin wrapper that calls into **DashboardService** methods (e.g., `DashboardService.getConstraintStatus()`) and returns a view model or JSON payload for the front‑end.  
4. **Middleware / Guarding** – Given the monitor’s operational nature, the router may include simple guard logic (authentication checks, health‑check validation) before delegating to service methods. This would be documented in the README as part of “routing mechanism” responsibilities.  

Because no source symbols are listed, the exact language‑specific constructs (e.g., Express.js `router`, Spring `@RequestMapping`, or Go `http.ServeMux`) cannot be confirmed. The design, however, is clearly intended to keep routing concerns isolated while still allowing **DashboardService** to own the underlying business behaviour.

## Integration Points  

**DashboardRouter** sits at the intersection of three major system areas:

1. **MCP Constraint Monitor Core** – The higher‑level `integrations/mcp-constraint-monitor/README.md` indicates that the monitor interacts with the dashboard. The router therefore must expose endpoints that the monitor’s backend can call to retrieve status, push alerts, or receive configuration changes.  
2. **DashboardService** – As its parent, the router directly invokes service methods. Any change in the service API (e.g., a new method to fetch constraint violations) will require a corresponding route registration.  
3. **External UI / Clients** – Users or automated tools will issue HTTP (or RPC) requests against the router’s endpoints. The router therefore defines the public contract of the dashboard, and its README likely enumerates the available URLs, request/response schemas, and any required authentication tokens.  

No explicit dependency files are listed, but the router is expected to depend on a minimal HTTP framework (or the platform’s built‑in routing facilities) and on the internal data models provided by **DashboardService**.

## Usage Guidelines  

* **Initialize via DashboardService** – Developers should never instantiate `DashboardRouter` directly; instead, obtain it through the `DashboardService` constructor or factory method to guarantee that all required dependencies (e.g., data repositories, logging) are wired correctly.  
* **Route Registration Discipline** – When adding a new dashboard page, follow the pattern described in `integrations/mcp-constraint-monitor/dashboard/README.md`: register the path, bind it to a handler that delegates to a clearly named service method, and document the endpoint in the README. This keeps the router’s surface area predictable.  
* **Keep Handlers Thin** – Handlers should only translate request parameters and forward them to `DashboardService`. Business logic belongs in the service layer, preserving the router’s role as a thin dispatcher.  
* **Guard Sensitive Routes** – If the dashboard exposes operations that can alter monitoring behaviour (e.g., start/stop constraints), ensure that the router enforces authentication/authorization checks as outlined in the README.  
* **Version the API** – Although not explicitly mentioned, the router’s public endpoints form an API. When breaking changes are required, introduce a versioned path prefix (e.g., `/v2/constraints`) to avoid disrupting existing clients.

### Architectural Patterns Identified  

1. **Router / Front‑Controller Pattern** – Centralises request handling for the dashboard UI.  
2. **Service‑Component Composition** – `DashboardService` aggregates `DashboardRouter`, reflecting a hierarchical service design.  

### Design Decisions and Trade‑offs  

* **Tight Coupling vs. Simplicity** – Embedding the router within the service simplifies internal calls and reduces latency but makes the router harder to reuse in other contexts.  
* **Thin Handlers vs. Business Logic Placement** – Keeping handlers lightweight encourages a clean separation of concerns, but may require more boilerplate to map request data to service calls.  

### System Structure Insights  

* The dashboard subsystem is a **leaf component** under the broader MCP Constraint Monitor integration, with a clear parent (`DashboardService`) and no visible child components.  
* All routing definitions are likely consolidated in a single module, making the routing map a single source of truth for UI navigation.  

### Scalability Considerations  

* Because the router is a single entry point, scaling the dashboard horizontally will require the routing logic to be stateless or to share session state via an external store.  
* Adding new routes does not affect existing performance; the router can lazily load handlers or use a lookup table with O(1) access.  

### Maintainability Assessment  

* **Positive** – Centralised routing improves discoverability; documentation in the README provides a living map of available endpoints.  
* **Risk** – The absence of explicit code symbols in the current view makes automated analysis difficult; any change to the service API must be mirrored in the router, demanding disciplined code reviews.  
* **Mitigation** – Maintaining the README as the authoritative contract and enforcing a “router‑only‑dispatch” rule will keep the component maintainable as the system evolves.
