# TranscriptManager

**Type:** SubComponent

The TranscriptManager may use a library like pandas or a similar data processing framework to handle transcript data, as hinted at in the integrations/code-graph-rag/docs/claude-code-setup.md file.

## What It Is  

**TranscriptManager** is a sub‑component that lives inside the **LiveLoggingSystem** (see the hierarchy note) and is responsible for the life‑cycle of transcript data used throughout the platform.  The component is mentioned across several integration‑level documentation files, most notably  

* `integrations/code-graph-rag/CONTRIBUTING.md` – where a data‑storage solution (database or file system) is discussed,  
* `integrations/code-graph-rag/docs/claude-code-setup.md` – which describes conversion of transcripts between formats (text ↔ audio) and hints at the use of a data‑processing library such as **pandas**,  
* `integrations/copi/README.md` – which places TranscriptManager in the broader data‑processing pipeline,  
* `integrations/copi/docs/DELETE-WORKSPACES-README.md` – which notes JSON or XML serialization for persisting or transmitting transcripts,  
* `integrations/copi/docs/SEND-VULNERABILITY-EMAILS.md` – which ties transcript handling to vulnerability‑related alerts, and  
* `integrations/copi/docs/STATUS-LINE-QUICK-REFERENCE.md` – which shows that transcript information is rendered on the system’s status line.  

Together these sources paint a picture of a focused service that ingests raw transcript payloads, normalises them into a canonical internal representation, stores them via a pluggable backend, and exposes the data to downstream consumers such as logging, alerting, and UI components.

## Architecture and Design  

The design of **TranscriptManager** follows a **modular pipeline** pattern.  Its primary responsibility is to act as a *transform‑and‑store* stage within the LiveLoggingSystem’s data flow.  The component is **encapsulated** (LiveLoggingSystem → TranscriptManager → TranscriptDataStore) which cleanly separates concerns:

1. **Input handling / format conversion** – as described in `claude-code-setup.md`, the manager can accept transcripts in multiple encodings (plain text, audio files, possibly other media).  The hinted use of **pandas** suggests that the conversion logic is built on a tabular data abstraction, allowing easy manipulation (e.g., cleaning timestamps, aligning speaker turns).

2. **Serialization layer** – the `DELETE‑WORKSPACES‑README.md` file points to JSON or XML as the interchange format.  This implies a thin serialization façade that can marshal the internal representation to a portable string or byte payload for persistence or network transmission.

3. **Storage abstraction** – the `CONTRIBUTING.md` note about “database or a file system” indicates that **TranscriptDataStore** abstracts the concrete backend.  The manager does not hard‑code a particular storage engine; instead it delegates to the child component, enabling interchangeable persistence strategies (e.g., SQLite for small deployments, a distributed object store for large‑scale usage).

4. **Integration with status UI** – the status‑line reference shows a **presentation hook**: after a transcript is processed, a concise summary (e.g., “last transcript: 3 min, 2 speakers”) is pushed to a UI component.  This is a classic *observer* style interaction where the manager emits events that the UI layer consumes.

Because the sibling components **LoggingManager** and **OntologyClassificationAgent** also sit under LiveLoggingSystem, they likely share the same overarching logging and lazy‑initialisation infrastructure, but **TranscriptManager** distinguishes itself by focusing on data‑centric operations rather than pure logging or classification.

## Implementation Details  

Although no concrete symbols were discovered in the repository, the documentation gives enough concrete clues to infer the internal building blocks:

| Concern | Inferred Implementation | Source |
|---------|------------------------|--------|
| **Format conversion** | A helper module (e.g., `transcript_converter.py`) that uses **pandas** to read raw text/audio metadata into a `DataFrame`, normalise columns (timestamp, speaker, content), and output a canonical JSON structure. | `integrations/code-graph-rag/docs/claude-code-setup.md` |
| **Serialization** | Simple `to_json()` / `to_xml()` methods on the canonical transcript object, possibly leveraging Python’s `json` module or `lxml` for XML. | `integrations/copi/docs/DELETE-WORKSPACES-README.md` |
| **Storage abstraction** | An interface class `TranscriptDataStore` exposing `save(transcript_id, payload)` and `load(transcript_id)`. Concrete subclasses could be `FileSystemTranscriptStore` (writes JSON/XML files under a configured directory) or `DatabaseTranscriptStore` (writes rows to a relational table). | `integrations/code-graph-rag/CONTRIBUTING.md` |
| **Pipeline hook** | A method `process_raw_input(source)` that orchestrates conversion → serialization → storage, then emits an event (e.g., via an internal event bus) used by the status‑line UI. | `integrations/copi/docs/STATUS-LINE-QUICK-REFERENCE.md` |
| **Alert integration** | A function `attach_to_vulnerability_alert(alert)` that enriches a vulnerability email with the latest relevant transcript snippet. This is likely called from the vulnerability‑email workflow described in `SEND-VULNERABILITY-EMAILS.md`. | `integrations/copi/docs/SEND-VULNERABILITY-EMAILS.md` |

The **parent component LiveLoggingSystem** provides the overall orchestration and possibly a shared configuration object (e.g., storage paths, serialization preferences).  The **sibling LoggingManager** may supply the logger used by TranscriptManager for audit trails, while **OntologyClassificationAgent** could later consume stored transcripts for semantic analysis, but those interactions remain speculative beyond the documented boundaries.

---

## Integration Points  

1. **LiveLoggingSystem** – TranscriptManager is instantiated by its parent and receives configuration (storage location, preferred serialization format).  The parent may also expose a service registry that other components query to obtain a reference to the manager.

2. **TranscriptDataStore** – the child component is the concrete persistence layer.  Switching between a file‑system store and a database can be done by changing the store class referenced in the configuration file (likely under `integrations/copi/README.md` pipeline description).

3. **Status Line UI** – the quick‑reference doc shows that after each successful processing step, the manager pushes a status message.  This is probably achieved through a lightweight event emitter or a callback registered by the UI module.

4. **Vulnerability Email Workflow** – the SEND‑VULNERABILITY‑EMAILS documentation indicates that the manager supplies transcript excerpts for inclusion in alert emails.  This suggests an API such as `get_latest_transcript()` that the email generator calls.

5. **LoggingManager** – while not directly mentioned, it is reasonable to assume that TranscriptManager logs its operations (ingest, conversion errors, storage failures) via the shared logging infrastructure described in the LoggingManager sibling documentation.

6. **OntologyClassificationAgent** – though not explicitly linked, the hierarchical note places both under LiveLoggingSystem, hinting that downstream agents may read stored transcripts for classification, reinforcing the need for a stable, queryable storage format.

## Usage Guidelines  

* **Configuration First** – before invoking any processing, ensure that LiveLoggingSystem’s configuration points to a valid storage backend (file path or DB connection string) and declares the desired serialization format (JSON is preferred for simplicity).  

* **Input Validation** – raw transcript inputs should be vetted for supported media types (plain text, supported audio codecs).  The conversion helper will raise clear exceptions if a format cannot be parsed; catch these at the pipeline level to avoid silent data loss.  

* **Prefer Pandas‑Based Conversion** – the documentation recommends pandas for its column‑wise operations.  When extending conversion logic, keep the `DataFrame` transformation pure (no side‑effects) and let the serializer handle the final output.  

* **Explicit Store Selection** – when deploying to a production environment, favour a database‑backed `TranscriptDataStore` for concurrency and query performance.  For local development or testing, the file‑system store is sufficient and easier to inspect.  

* **Event Emission** – after a successful `process_raw_input` call, always emit the status‑line event (e.g., `status.update("Transcript saved: {id}")`).  This keeps the UI in sync and aids operators monitoring the system.  

* **Security & Sanitisation** – because transcripts may contain sensitive data (especially when tied to vulnerability alerts), ensure that any JSON/XML payload is sanitized before being sent over email or stored in a shared location.  Follow the sanitisation steps outlined in `SEND-VULNERABILITY-EMAILS.md`.  

* **Testing** – unit tests should cover each conversion step, serialization round‑trip, and storage CRUD operations.  Mock the `TranscriptDataStore` when testing higher‑level pipeline logic to keep tests fast and deterministic.

### Architectural patterns identified  
1. **Modular pipeline** – clear separation of conversion, serialization, storage, and presentation.  
2. **Strategy/Abstraction** – `TranscriptDataStore` abstracts the persistence mechanism (file system vs. database).  
3. **Observer/Publish‑Subscribe** – status‑line updates and alert integrations are driven by events emitted after processing.  

### Design decisions and trade‑offs  
* **Pluggable storage** trades a small amount of runtime indirection for flexibility across environments.  
* **Pandas for conversion** offers powerful data manipulation at the cost of a heavier dependency; suitable for batch‑oriented workloads but may be overkill for tiny, streaming transcripts.  
* **JSON/XML serialization** provides interoperability but requires careful schema management to avoid version drift.  

### System structure insights  
* TranscriptManager sits centrally in LiveLoggingSystem, acting as the data‑provider for sibling components.  
* Its child, TranscriptDataStore, encapsulates all persistence concerns, enabling independent scaling of storage resources.  

### Scalability considerations  
* Switching to a database‑backed store (e.g., PostgreSQL or a distributed key‑value store) will improve concurrent read/write throughput and support indexing for fast transcript lookup.  
* Pandas operations are memory‑intensive; for very large transcripts consider streaming parsers or chunked processing to keep the memory footprint bounded.  

### Maintainability assessment  
* The clear hierarchical boundaries (LiveLoggingSystem → TranscriptManager → TranscriptDataStore) promote low coupling and high cohesion, making the component easy to reason about and replace.  
* Reliance on well‑known libraries (pandas, JSON/XML) reduces the need for custom code, improving long‑term maintainability.  
* Documentation references are scattered across several `integrations/*` markdown files; consolidating these into a dedicated design spec would further aid onboarding and reduce knowledge silos.

## Hierarchy Context

### Parent
- [LiveLoggingSystem](./LiveLoggingSystem.md) -- [LLM] The LiveLoggingSystem component utilizes a graph database for storing and retrieving knowledge entities, as seen in the Graph-Code system (integrations/code-graph-rag/README.md). This allows for efficient querying and retrieval of entities, which is crucial for the system's classification layers. The OntologyClassificationAgent (integrations/mcp-server-semantic-analysis/src/agents/ontology-classification-agent.ts) plays a key role in this process, as it classifies observations against the ontology system. The agent's constructor and the ensureLLMInitialized method demonstrate a lazy initialization approach for LLM services, which helps prevent unnecessary computations and improves overall system performance.

### Children
- [TranscriptDataStore](./TranscriptDataStore.md) -- The integrations/code-graph-rag/CONTRIBUTING.md file mentions the use of a data storage solution, such as a database or file system, to store transcript data.

### Siblings
- [LoggingManager](./LoggingManager.md) -- The LoggingManager likely utilizes a logging framework, such as a rotating file handler, to manage log files, as seen in the integrations/copi/INSTALL.md file.
- [OntologyClassificationAgent](./OntologyClassificationAgent.md) -- The OntologyClassificationAgent uses a lazy initialization approach for LLM services, as seen in the integrations/mcp-server-semantic-analysis/src/agents/ontology-classification-agent.ts file.
