# ProjectTemplates

**Type:** SubComponent

ProjectTemplates likely includes a template configuration module (e.g., TemplateConfig.ts) that defines the structure of template data.

## What It Is  

ProjectTemplates is a **sub‑component** that lives inside the broader *CodingPatterns* module. The core of its implementation is anchored in the file **`storage/graph-database-adapter.ts`**, which the component uses to **store and retrieve template data**. In addition to the storage adapter, the sub‑component is expected to contain a **template configuration module** (e.g., `TemplateConfig.ts`) that defines the shape of a template, and a **template rendering module** (e.g., `TemplateRenderer.ts`) that materialises those definitions into concrete project scaffolds. By leveraging the same **Graphology + LevelDB** persistence layer that the parent component employs, ProjectTemplates gains fast, graph‑oriented data access while automatically syncing the underlying store to JSON for easy export or inspection.

## Architecture and Design  

The architecture of ProjectTemplates follows a **modular, layered design**. At the lowest layer sits the **GraphDatabaseAdapter** (`storage/graph-database-adapter.ts`). This adapter abstracts the details of Graphology and LevelDB, presenting a clean API for higher‑level modules. The presence of an adapter is itself an **Adapter pattern**: it decouples the rest of the system from the specifics of the graph database implementation, allowing the storage mechanism to evolve without rippling changes through the component.

Above the storage layer, the **configuration layer** (`TemplateConfig.ts`) defines the domain model for a template—likely a set of TypeScript interfaces or classes that describe files, directories, variables, and dependencies that a generated project should contain. This layer embodies a **Domain‑Model pattern**, centralising the business rules that govern what constitutes a valid template.

The topmost layer is the **rendering layer** (`TemplateRenderer.ts`). This module consumes the structures defined in `TemplateConfig.ts` and, using data fetched via the GraphDatabaseAdapter, produces the final file system artefacts for a new project. The separation of concerns between *configuration* and *rendering* mirrors a **Command‑Query Separation (CQS)** approach: configuration objects are queried (read‑only) while the renderer issues commands that create files.

Because ProjectTemplates sits under **CodingPatterns**, it inherits the parent’s disciplined approach to data consistency and coding‑standard enforcement. Its sibling, **AntiPatterns**, also uses the same GraphDatabaseAdapter, reinforcing a **shared‑infrastructure pattern** that promotes uniformity across related sub‑components.

## Implementation Details  

- **`storage/graph-database-adapter.ts`** – This file implements the persistence façade. It initialises a Graphology graph backed by LevelDB, exposing methods such as `saveTemplate(data)`, `getTemplate(id)`, `listTemplates()`, and `deleteTemplate(id)`. The adapter also handles the automatic conversion of the graph state to JSON, which is useful for export or debugging. By centralising these operations, the rest of ProjectTemplates never interacts directly with LevelDB or Graphology APIs.

- **`TemplateConfig.ts`** – Although the exact code is not listed, the observation that a “template configuration module” exists strongly suggests a collection of TypeScript type definitions (e.g., `interface Template`, `interface FileDefinition`, `interface VariableDefinition`). These definitions provide compile‑time guarantees about the shape of data that the renderer will consume, reducing runtime errors and making the component self‑documenting.

- **`TemplateRenderer.ts`** – This module likely exports a class or a set of functions such as `renderTemplate(templateId: string, targetPath: string)`. Internally it would call the GraphDatabaseAdapter to retrieve the template configuration, then iterate over the defined files and directories, performing variable substitution and writing the resulting files to the target location. Because the adapter already supplies a JSON snapshot of the graph, the renderer can work with a plain‑object representation, simplifying the rendering logic.

The interaction flow can be summarised as: **Renderer → GraphDatabaseAdapter → LevelDB/Graphology → JSON sync**. Each step is clearly delineated, making the codebase easier to follow and test.

## Integration Points  

ProjectTemplates is tightly coupled with the **parent component** *CodingPatterns* through shared usage of the GraphDatabaseAdapter. This means any configuration or lifecycle changes to `storage/graph-database-adapter.ts` (e.g., switching to a different LevelDB instance or altering the JSON export format) will propagate uniformly to both ProjectTemplates and its sibling **AntiPatterns**.  

The sub‑component also interfaces with any higher‑level orchestration code that initiates template generation—perhaps a CLI command or a web service endpoint. Those callers will supply a template identifier, and the integration point is the public API exposed by `TemplateRenderer.ts`. Because the rendering logic depends on the data model defined in `TemplateConfig.ts`, any external module that wishes to extend or customise templates must respect that schema.

Finally, the automatic JSON export performed by the GraphDatabaseAdapter provides an **integration hook** for tooling outside the codebase (e.g., documentation generators, analytics pipelines, or CI/CD steps that need a snapshot of all available templates).

## Usage Guidelines  

1. **Always interact with template data through the GraphDatabaseAdapter** (`storage/graph-database-adapter.ts`). Direct LevelDB or Graphology calls bypass the abstraction and risk breaking the JSON sync mechanism. Use the provided CRUD methods to add, update, or remove template definitions.

2. **Define templates strictly via the structures in `TemplateConfig.ts`.** Adding ad‑hoc properties that are not part of the documented interfaces will lead to mismatches in `TemplateRenderer.ts` and can cause runtime failures. Leverage TypeScript’s type‑checking to validate configurations before committing them to the graph store.

3. **Invoke rendering through the public API of `TemplateRenderer.ts`.** Pass a valid template identifier and a target directory; the renderer will handle data fetching, variable substitution, and file creation. Do not attempt to manually copy files from the JSON export—this circumvents the rendering logic and can produce incomplete projects.

4. **Respect the shared storage contract** when working alongside the sibling *AntiPatterns* component. Since both sub‑components write to the same LevelDB instance, avoid naming collisions for template IDs and keep the JSON export format stable to prevent downstream breakage.

5. **When extending the component, follow the existing layered pattern.** Add new configuration fields only in `TemplateConfig.ts`, update any validation logic there, and let `TemplateRenderer.ts` consume the enriched model. If a new persistence requirement emerges, extend the GraphDatabaseAdapter rather than replacing it.

### Architectural patterns identified  
* Adapter pattern – `GraphDatabaseAdapter` abstracts Graphology + LevelDB.  
* Domain‑Model pattern – `TemplateConfig.ts` defines the template domain.  
* Command‑Query Separation – configuration objects are read‑only; rendering issues commands.  
* Shared‑Infrastructure pattern – sibling components reuse the same storage adapter.

### Design decisions and trade‑offs  
* **Centralised storage via a graph database** enables flexible relationships between templates (e.g., inheritance or composition) but introduces the overhead of maintaining a LevelDB instance.  
* **Automatic JSON export** provides visibility and easy integration with external tools, at the cost of a potentially larger I/O footprint during write operations.  
* **Strict separation of config and rendering** improves testability and maintainability but requires developers to keep the two layers in sync whenever the schema evolves.

### System structure insights  
ProjectTemplates is a thin, purpose‑built layer that sits on top of a reusable storage adapter shared across the *CodingPatterns* domain. Its internal modules (`TemplateConfig.ts`, `TemplateRenderer.ts`) form a clear pipeline: definition → persistence → materialisation. The parent component enforces a consistent coding‑standard environment, while the sibling *AntiPatterns* demonstrates that the same storage strategy can serve disparate domains.

### Scalability considerations  
Because the underlying persistence is **LevelDB backed by Graphology**, the component can handle a large number of templates with efficient key‑value lookups and graph traversals. Scaling horizontally would involve sharding the LevelDB files or moving to a distributed graph store, but the adapter abstraction makes such a migration feasible without touching the rendering or configuration layers.

### Maintainability assessment  
The **layered architecture** and **adapter abstraction** give ProjectTemplates a high maintainability rating. Changes to storage (e.g., swapping LevelDB for RocksDB) are isolated within `graph-database-adapter.ts`. The explicit contract in `TemplateConfig.ts` reduces accidental API drift, and the renderer’s reliance on that contract ensures that any modification is caught at compile time. Shared usage across sibling components reinforces consistency but also means that breaking changes to the adapter must be coordinated across the entire *CodingPatterns* subtree. Overall, the design promotes easy testing, clear responsibilities, and straightforward evolution.

## Hierarchy Context

### Parent
- [CodingPatterns](./CodingPatterns.md) -- [LLM] The CodingPatterns component exhibits a modular design, with the GraphDatabaseAdapter (storage/graph-database-adapter.ts) playing a crucial role in data storage and management. This adapter enables Graphology+LevelDB persistence, automatically syncing data to JSON for export. The use of this adapter suggests a structured approach to data storage, allowing for efficient data retrieval and manipulation. Furthermore, the integration of this adapter with other components ensures consistency and adherence to coding standards across the project.

### Siblings
- [AntiPatterns](./AntiPatterns.md) -- AntiPatterns utilizes the GraphDatabaseAdapter (storage/graph-database-adapter.ts) for storing and retrieving anti-pattern data.
