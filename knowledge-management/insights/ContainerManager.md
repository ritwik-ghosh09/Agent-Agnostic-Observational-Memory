# ContainerManager

**Type:** SubComponent

The ContainerManager sub-component employs a state machine to manage container states, ensuring that containers are properly transitioned between states and that the system remains consistent and reliable.

## What It Is  

ContainerManager is the **sub‑component** responsible for the full lifecycle management of Docker containers inside the **DockerizedServices** parent component. Its concrete implementation lives in the file **`lib/container-manager.js`**, which exposes a well‑documented JavaScript interface used by the rest of the system. The module talks directly to the Docker Engine through the Docker API, issuing *create*, *start* and *stop* commands, and it also embeds a state‑machine that tracks each container’s current status (e.g., *created*, *running*, *stopped*, *error*). In addition to lifecycle actions, ContainerManager supplies a built‑in logging facility that records container events and errors, and it is deliberately built to be **highly customizable** so that downstream developers can adapt its behaviour to particular workloads or operational policies.

---

## Architecture and Design  

The design of ContainerManager revolves around two explicit architectural choices that emerge from the observations:

1. **State‑Machine‑Driven Lifecycle Control** – By modeling container states as a finite state machine, the component guarantees that transitions (create → start → stop, etc.) are performed in a deterministic and validated order. This pattern eliminates race conditions and keeps the system consistent even when many containers are being manipulated concurrently.

2. **Docker‑API Integration Layer** – All container operations are funneled through the Docker API, providing a standardized and reliable communication channel with the Docker Engine. This abstracts the low‑level HTTP/Unix‑socket calls behind a clean JavaScript façade in `lib/container-manager.js`.

The component also incorporates a **logging mechanism** that captures lifecycle events and error conditions, enabling observability across the container fleet. Because the interface is described as “highly customizable,” the design likely exposes configuration hooks (e.g., callbacks, options objects) that allow callers to inject custom behaviour without modifying the core code.

Within the broader **DockerizedServices** hierarchy, ContainerManager sits alongside sibling sub‑components such as **ServiceStarter** (which implements a retry‑with‑backoff strategy in `lib/service-starter.js:104`) and **LLMFacade** (which follows a modular architecture for LLM operations). While ServiceStarter focuses on robust service startup, ContainerManager concentrates on container state integrity; both share the parent’s emphasis on reliability and fault tolerance. The modular separation means that ContainerManager can be evolved or swapped independently of the retry logic used by ServiceStarter.

## Implementation Details  

The heart of the implementation is the **`lib/container-manager.js`** module. Although the observation set does not list individual class or function names, the following logical pieces can be inferred:

| Concern | Likely Implementation Element | Observation Basis |
|---------|------------------------------|-------------------|
| Docker interaction | Wrapper functions (e.g., `createContainer()`, `startContainer()`, `stopContainer()`) that call the Docker API | “uses the Docker API to create, start, and stop containers” |
| State management | A state‑machine object or class that holds the current state per container and defines allowed transitions | “employs a state machine to manage container states” |
| Error handling | Centralized try/catch blocks that translate Docker‑API errors into ContainerManager‑specific exceptions | “handling container‑specific errors and exceptions” |
| Logging | Logger utility (perhaps using a library like `winston` or a home‑grown logger) that writes event records to stdout, file, or a monitoring sink | “provides a logging mechanism to track container events and errors” |
| Customizability | Options object passed to the constructor or exported `init` function, exposing hooks such as `onStateChange`, `onError`, or custom retry policies | “interface is designed to be highly customizable” |
| Scalability | Internal data structures (e.g., maps keyed by container ID) and asynchronous, non‑blocking API calls that allow many containers to be managed in parallel | “implementation is designed to be highly scalable, allowing it to manage large numbers of containers efficiently and reliably” |

The state machine likely defines states such as **`INITIALIZED`**, **`CREATED`**, **`RUNNING`**, **`STOPPED`**, and **`FAILED`**, with transition guards that prevent illegal moves (e.g., attempting to start a container that is already running). When a transition occurs, the logger records the event, and any registered custom callbacks are invoked, giving developers a hook to extend behaviour (e.g., emit metrics).

Because the component is built on top of the Docker API, it inherits Docker’s own reliability guarantees (container isolation, resource limits). The ContainerManager adds its own layer of reliability by ensuring that any Docker‑level error is caught, logged, and re‑thrown as a domain‑specific exception, making error handling consistent across the DockerizedServices ecosystem.

## Integration Points  

ContainerManager interacts with the rest of the system at several well‑defined junctions:

* **Parent – DockerizedServices** – The parent component aggregates ContainerManager alongside ServiceStarter and LLMFacade. DockerizedServices likely orchestrates the overall startup sequence: ServiceStarter may first bring up auxiliary services (using its retry‑with‑backoff logic), after which ContainerManager is invoked to spin up the containers that host those services. The parent thus benefits from ContainerManager’s state‑machine guarantees to keep the container fleet in a known good state.

* **Sibling – ServiceStarter** – While ServiceStarter focuses on retrying service launches, ContainerManager may be called by ServiceStarter when a service’s container needs to be recreated after a failure. The two components share the same reliability ethos but operate on different abstraction levels (service vs. container).

* **Sibling – LLMFacade** – LLMFacade provides a modular interface for language‑model operations. If an LLM is deployed inside a Docker container, ContainerManager would be the responsible entity for provisioning that container, while LLMFacade would communicate with the model once the container is running. This division of concerns keeps container provisioning separate from model‑specific logic.

* **External – Docker Engine** – The Docker API is the sole external dependency. All container actions are translated into Docker‑engine calls, meaning that any change in Docker’s API version or authentication model would directly affect ContainerManager.

* **Logging/Monitoring Stack** – The internal logging mechanism likely forwards events to a centralized logging system (e.g., Elastic Stack, CloudWatch). This enables operators to trace container lifecycles across the entire DockerizedServices platform.

## Usage Guidelines  

1. **Initialize with Explicit Options** – When importing `lib/container-manager.js`, supply an options object that defines any custom callbacks (`onStateChange`, `onError`) and logging preferences. This ensures that the component behaves consistently with the surrounding application’s observability standards.

2. **Respect the State Machine** – Callers should avoid invoking Docker actions directly; instead, use the provided high‑level methods (e.g., `create()`, `start()`, `stop()`). The state machine will enforce correct ordering and will reject illegal transitions, preventing race conditions.

3. **Handle Container‑Specific Exceptions** – All Docker‑API errors are wrapped in ContainerManager‑specific exception types. Catch these exceptions at the integration layer (e.g., in DockerizedServices) to implement graceful degradation or retry policies. Do not rely on generic JavaScript errors for container failure handling.

4. **Leverage Logging for Debugging** – The built‑in logger emits detailed events for every state transition and error. Configure the logging destination (file, stdout, external service) early in the application lifecycle to capture the full audit trail.

5. **Scale Thoughtfully** – While ContainerManager is designed for high scalability, developers should still monitor resource usage (CPU, memory, Docker socket limits) when managing very large container fleets. Consider batching container creation or using Docker’s built‑in swarm/compose features if the number of containers grows beyond a few hundred.

6. **Coordinate with ServiceStarter** – If a container fails to start, let ServiceStarter’s retry‑with‑backoff logic decide whether to attempt a restart. Do not embed ad‑hoc retry loops inside ContainerManager; this would duplicate the parent’s fault‑tolerance strategy.

### Architectural Patterns Identified
* State‑Machine pattern for container lifecycle management.  
* Wrapper/Adapter pattern for Docker API integration.  
* Logging/Observer pattern for event tracking.  
* Configurable/Strategy pattern enabling a highly customizable interface.

### Design Decisions and Trade‑offs
* **State machine vs. ad‑hoc checks** – Guarantees consistency but adds implementation complexity.  
* **Direct Docker API usage** – Provides low‑level control and reliability, at the cost of tighter coupling to Docker versioning.  
* **Customizable hooks** – Increases flexibility for downstream developers but requires careful documentation to avoid misuse.  
* **Scalability focus** – Asynchronous, non‑blocking calls enable large fleets, yet developers must still monitor Docker socket contention.

### System Structure Insights
ContainerManager sits as a core service‑provisioning block within DockerizedServices, complementing ServiceStarter’s retry logic and LLMFacade’s modular model interface. Its clear separation of concerns (container provisioning vs. service orchestration) promotes independent evolution of each sub‑component.

### Scalability Considerations
* Non‑blocking Docker API calls allow concurrent container operations.  
* Internal state‑machine maps enable O(1) state look‑ups per container.  
* Logging is performed asynchronously to avoid back‑pressure on the main lifecycle flow.  
* The design anticipates “large numbers of containers,” suggesting that resource‑efficient data structures and careful socket usage are already in place.

### Maintainability Assessment
Because ContainerManager centralizes Docker interactions, state handling, and logging within a single, well‑documented module (`lib/container-manager.js`), the codebase is relatively easy to understand and extend. The use of a state machine provides a clear, testable contract for container transitions. Customizable hooks are documented, reducing the risk of hidden side effects. However, tight coupling to the Docker API means that major Docker version upgrades will require coordinated updates to this module, representing the primary maintenance burden.

## Hierarchy Context

### Parent
- [DockerizedServices](./DockerizedServices.md) -- The DockerizedServices component utilizes the retry-with-backoff pattern in the startServiceWithRetry function (lib/service-starter.js:104) to prevent endless loops and provide a more robust solution when optional services fail. This pattern allows the component to handle temporary failures and provides a way to recover from them. The implementation of this pattern is crucial for the overall reliability of the component, as it prevents cascading failures and ensures that the system remains operational even when some services are temporarily unavailable. Furthermore, the use of exponential backoff in the retry logic helps to prevent overwhelming the system with repeated requests, which can lead to further failures and decreased performance.

### Siblings
- [ServiceStarter](./ServiceStarter.md) -- ServiceStarter uses the startServiceWithRetry function (lib/service-starter.js:104) to implement the retry-with-backoff pattern, preventing endless loops and providing a more robust solution when optional services fail.
- [LLMFacade](./LLMFacade.md) -- LLMFacade uses a modular architecture to provide a flexible and extensible interface for LLM operations, allowing developers to easily add or remove LLMs as needed.
