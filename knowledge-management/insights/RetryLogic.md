# RetryLogic

**Type:** Detail

The startServiceWithRetry function in lib/service-starter.js:104 uses a retry-with-backoff pattern to handle temporary service failures, ensuring that services can recover from errors and maintain system responsiveness.

## What It Is  

`RetryLogic` is the concrete implementation of a **retry‑with‑backoff** strategy that lives in `retry-logic.ts`.  It is invoked by the `ServiceStarter` component through the helper `startServiceWithRetry` found at **`lib/service-starter.js:104`**.  The purpose of this module is to shield the rest of the system from transient failures of optional services by automatically re‑invoking the start‑up routine with an increasing delay between attempts.  The back‑off timing is delegated to the `exponentialBackoff` function defined in `backoff.ts`, which produces the progressively larger wait intervals.  In short, `RetryLogic` is the reusable, type‑safe (TypeScript) engine that powers the resilient start‑up flow for services managed by `ServiceStarter`.

---

## Architecture and Design  

The observations reveal a **layered retry‑with‑backoff architecture**.  At the highest level, `ServiceStarter` owns the orchestration of service lifecycles and delegates any temporary start‑up failure handling to `RetryLogic`.  This separation of concerns keeps the core start‑up code (`startServiceWithRetry`) clean and focused on *what* to start, while `RetryLogic` concentrates on *how* to retry.  

The design follows the **Strategy pattern** in a lightweight form: the retry algorithm (exponential back‑off) is encapsulated in `exponentialBackoff` (in `backoff.ts`) and injected/used by `RetryLogic`.  By isolating the back‑off calculation, the system can swap the algorithm (e.g., linear or jittered back‑off) without touching the surrounding retry loop.  

Interaction flow (as inferred from the file paths):  

1. `ServiceStarter` calls `startServiceWithRetry` (lib/service-starter.js:104).  
2. `startServiceWithRetry` invokes the exported retry routine from `retry-logic.ts`.  
3. Inside `RetryLogic`, each retry iteration obtains the next delay by calling `exponentialBackoff` from `backoff.ts`.  
4. The delay is applied (likely via a `setTimeout`/`await`), then the original service start function is retried.  

This chain demonstrates a **composition** relationship: `ServiceStarter → RetryLogic → exponentialBackoff`.  The architecture therefore promotes reuse (the same `RetryLogic` can be used by any optional service) and testability (the back‑off function can be unit‑tested in isolation).

---

## Implementation Details  

`RetryLogic` (retry-logic.ts) encapsulates the retry loop.  Though the source code is not shown, the observations tell us that it **uses the `exponentialBackoff` function** from `backoff.ts`.  The typical implementation pattern is:

```ts
export async function withRetry<T>(operation: () => Promise<T>, maxAttempts = 5): Promise<T> {
  for (let attempt = 0; attempt < maxAttempts; attempt++) {
    try {
      return await operation();
    } catch (err) {
      if (attempt === maxAttempts - 1) throw err;   // give up after final attempt
      const delayMs = exponentialBackoff(attempt); // increasing delay per attempt
      await new Promise(res => setTimeout(res, delayMs));
    }
  }
}
```

The `exponentialBackoff` function likely follows the classic formula `baseDelay * 2^attempt`, possibly with a jitter factor to avoid thundering‑herd effects.  By placing this logic in a dedicated module, the system can adjust the base delay, maximum attempts, or jitter policy centrally.

`startServiceWithRetry` in **`lib/service-starter.js:104`** is a thin wrapper around this utility.  Its responsibilities are:

* Detect a failure when attempting to start an optional service.  
* Call `RetryLogic` with the start operation as a callback.  
* Ensure that the retry loop does **not** become an endless loop—this is enforced by a maximum‑attempt guard inside `RetryLogic`.  

Because `ServiceStarter` is the parent component, any child service that is optional will inherit this retry behavior automatically, without each service needing its own retry code.

---

## Integration Points  

* **Parent – ServiceStarter**: `ServiceStarter` imports and invokes `startServiceWithRetry`.  This creates a direct dependency on `retry-logic.ts`.  The parent supplies the actual service‑start callback, which may be a promise‑based function that attempts to connect to an external dependency (e.g., a database, cache, or third‑party API).  

* **Sibling – Other Optional Services**: Any other optional service that `ServiceStarter` manages can reuse the same `RetryLogic`.  Because the retry engine is stateless and pure (it only consumes the operation and back‑off function), siblings share the exact same resilience semantics.  

* **Child – exponentialBackoff (backoff.ts)**: `RetryLogic` calls `exponentialBackoff` for each attempt.  This module is a pure utility that calculates delay intervals; it does not depend on external state, making it easy to replace or extend.  

* **External Interfaces**: The only external contract `RetryLogic` requires is a **function returning a Promise** (the operation to retry).  This generic signature allows it to be used across any asynchronous start‑up routine, whether the service is a local module or a remote HTTP client.

---

## Usage Guidelines  

1. **Wrap only transient, optional operations** – `RetryLogic` is intended for services that can be started later if they fail initially.  Critical services that must succeed on the first attempt should be handled differently to avoid masking permanent failures.  

2. **Configure sensible limits** – While the observations do not expose configuration knobs, the implementation likely supports a maximum‑attempt count.  Choose a limit that balances recovery time against start‑up latency; typical values range from 3‑5 attempts.  

3. **Prefer exponential back‑off with jitter** – If you need to adjust the back‑off strategy, modify `exponentialBackoff` in `backoff.ts`.  Adding random jitter reduces the chance of synchronized retries across multiple instances.  

4. **Do not swallow errors** – After the final retry, `RetryLogic` should re‑throw the original error so that `ServiceStarter` can decide whether to mark the service as unavailable or trigger a fallback path.  

5. **Keep the operation pure** – The callback passed to `startServiceWithRetry` should be idempotent or safe to invoke multiple times, because the retry loop may call it repeatedly.

### Architectural patterns identified  

* **Retry‑with‑Backoff** (explicitly mentioned)  
* **Strategy** – back‑off calculation is abstracted into `exponentialBackoff`  
* **Composition / Delegation** – `ServiceStarter` delegates retry concerns to `RetryLogic`  

### Design decisions and trade‑offs  

* **Separation of concerns** – By moving retry logic out of `ServiceStarter`, the codebase stays modular, but it adds an extra indirection that developers must understand.  
* **Exponential back‑off** – Provides rapid recovery for short‑lived glitches while protecting downstream services from overload, at the cost of longer wait times if the problem persists.  
* **Maximum‑attempt guard** – Prevents endless loops, ensuring start‑up does not hang indefinitely; however, it may give up on services that could recover after many attempts.  

### System structure insights  

The system is organized around a **core orchestration component (`ServiceStarter`)** with a **pluggable resilience layer (`RetryLogic`)**.  The back‑off utility (`backoff.ts`) sits at the bottom as a pure function, making the retry stack easy to test in isolation.  

### Scalability considerations  

Because `RetryLogic` is stateless and uses asynchronous delays, it scales horizontally: multiple instances of `ServiceStarter` can run concurrent retries without contention.  The exponential back‑off naturally throttles retry traffic, protecting dependent services as the number of instances grows.  

### Maintainability assessment  

The clear division—`ServiceStarter` (orchestration), `RetryLogic` (retry engine), `exponentialBackoff` (timing)—makes the codebase **highly maintainable**.  Updates to the back‑off algorithm or retry policy require changes in a single location (`backoff.ts` or `retry-logic.ts`) without touching each service’s start‑up code.  The only maintenance risk is ensuring that all optional services provide idempotent start functions, a requirement that must be documented and enforced across the codebase.

## Hierarchy Context

### Parent
- [ServiceStarter](./ServiceStarter.md) -- ServiceStarter uses the startServiceWithRetry function (lib/service-starter.js:104) to implement the retry-with-backoff pattern, preventing endless loops and providing a more robust solution when optional services fail.
