# CircuitBreakerManager

**Type:** SubComponent

CircuitBreakerManager monitors the availability of LLM providers and triggers the circuit breaker when a provider becomes unavailable

## What It Is  

The **CircuitBreakerManager** is the resilience‑focused sub‑component that lives inside the **LLMAbstraction** layer.  Although the exact source file is not enumerated in the observations, its logical placement is clear: it is instantiated by *LLMAbstraction* and works hand‑in‑hand with the **ProviderRegistry** implementation found at `lib/llm/provider-registry.js`.  Its primary responsibility is to protect the LLM abstraction from cascading failures caused by an unavailable large‑language‑model (LLM) provider.  It does this by continuously monitoring the health of each registered provider, opening a circuit when a provider is deemed unavailable, and routing subsequent requests either to a fallback path or to a different healthy provider.  The manager also exposes a configurable surface—through its child **CircuitBreakerConfigurator**—that lets operators tune timeout windows, retry counts, and other circuit‑breaker policies.

## Architecture and Design  

The design of **CircuitBreakerManager** is a textbook application of the *Circuit Breaker* pattern.  By wrapping calls to LLM providers with a stateful guard (closed → open → half‑open), the manager prevents a flurry of failing calls from overwhelming the system and from propagating errors upward into the *LLMAbstraction* component.  The manager’s reliance on **ProviderRegistry** (`lib/llm/provider-registry.js`) demonstrates a *Service Locator*‑style decoupling: the registry maintains the authoritative list of providers, while the circuit‑breaker logic merely queries that list to assess health.  This separation of concerns keeps provider discovery independent from failure handling.

Composition is another evident pattern.  **CircuitBreakerManager** *contains* a **CircuitBreakerConfigurator**, which isolates configuration concerns from runtime logic.  The configurator likely reads a static configuration file or environment variables to materialise timeout thresholds, retry back‑off strategies, and the number of allowed failures before tripping the circuit.  By externalising these knobs, the system can be retuned without code changes, supporting operational flexibility.

The manager also implements a *Fallback* strategy.  When a provider’s circuit is open, the manager supplies an alternate handling path—either a cached response, a degraded‑service response, or a redirection to another healthy provider.  This aligns with the *Graceful Degradation* principle, ensuring that the overall LLM service remains usable even when individual back‑ends falter.

## Implementation Details  

At runtime, **CircuitBreakerManager** repeatedly invokes the **ProviderRegistry** API (e.g., `getProvider`, `listProviders`) to obtain the current catalogue of LLM back‑ends.  For each provider, it tracks health metrics such as recent error counts and latency.  When the observed failure rate exceeds the threshold defined in **CircuitBreakerConfigurator**, the manager flips the provider’s circuit to the *open* state and starts a timeout timer.  During the open period, any request from *LLMAbstraction* that targets the affected provider is short‑circuited; the manager either returns a predefined fallback payload or forwards the request to an alternate provider that remains in the *closed* state.

Configuration is encapsulated in the **CircuitBreakerConfigurator** child component.  While the exact file path is not listed, the observation that it “would likely define the timeout and retry policies in a configuration file, potentially in a separate module or class” indicates a clear separation: the configurator reads a JSON/YAML file or environment variables at startup, validates the values, and exposes them through a simple accessor interface (e.g., `getTimeoutMs()`, `getRetryCount()`).  The manager consumes these accessors whenever it evaluates health or decides whether to transition a circuit.

The fallback mechanism is part of the manager’s public API.  When a request is intercepted, the manager checks the circuit state; if the circuit is open, it invokes a fallback handler (potentially a method like `handleFallback(request)`) that can either supply a static response, invoke a secondary provider, or raise a controlled error that the *LLMAbstraction* layer knows how to surface to callers.

## Integration Points  

**CircuitBreakerManager** sits directly beneath *LLMAbstraction*, acting as a protective middleware.  The parent component delegates all outbound LLM calls to the manager, which in turn consults **ProviderRegistry** (`lib/llm/provider-registry.js`) for provider metadata and health status.  The manager also shares a sibling relationship with **DMRManager** and **ProviderRegistryManager**, all of which rely on the same underlying registry to discover providers.  Unlike its siblings, which focus on registration and direct provider interaction, the circuit‑breaker adds resilience semantics on top of the same provider list.

External modules that wish to influence behaviour—such as a DevOps team adjusting retry policies—interact with the **CircuitBreakerConfigurator** child.  Because the configurator is a distinct object, it can be swapped out or re‑initialised without touching the manager’s core logic, facilitating hot‑reloading of policies if the system supports it.  The manager also exposes a minimal public interface to *LLMAbstraction* (e.g., `execute(request)`) that hides the complexity of health checks and fallback handling, preserving a clean contract for callers.

## Usage Guidelines  

Developers integrating new LLM providers should register them through **ProviderRegistry** as described in the parent component’s documentation (see `lib/llm/provider-registry.js`).  Once registered, the **CircuitBreakerManager** will automatically begin monitoring the provider’s health; no additional wiring is required.  When adding a provider that has known latency spikes or intermittent outages, it is advisable to tailor the circuit‑breaker thresholds in the **CircuitBreakerConfigurator**—for instance, by increasing the failure‑count threshold or extending the open‑state timeout—to avoid premature tripping.

When invoking the LLM service, callers must go through *LLMAbstraction* rather than contacting providers directly.  This ensures that the circuit‑breaker logic is applied uniformly.  If a fallback response is required (e.g., a cached answer), developers should implement the fallback handler within **CircuitBreakerManager** or provide a custom strategy via dependency injection, keeping the fallback logic isolated from business code.

Finally, operators should monitor the circuit‑breaker metrics—open/closed state transitions, failure rates, and fallback usage—through the system’s observability stack.  Adjusting the parameters in **CircuitBreakerConfigurator** should be done in response to observed patterns, balancing availability against the risk of masking persistent provider issues.

### Architectural patterns identified  
1. **Circuit Breaker** – isolates failures of individual LLM providers.  
2. **Service Locator / Registry** – uses `ProviderRegistry` to discover providers.  
3. **Configurator / Externalized Configuration** – separates policy definition via **CircuitBreakerConfigurator**.  
4. **Fallback / Graceful Degradation** – supplies alternate handling when a provider is unavailable.  

### Design decisions and trade‑offs  
- **Decoupling health logic from provider registration** keeps the registry simple but adds an extra coordination layer (CircuitBreakerManager).  
- **Externalising timeout and retry settings** enables runtime tuning but introduces configuration‑drift risk if not version‑controlled.  
- **Per‑provider circuit state** offers fine‑grained resilience but increases memory footprint and state‑management complexity.  

### System structure insights  
- **CircuitBreakerManager** is a child of **LLMAbstraction**, reinforcing a layered architecture where resilience is a cross‑cutting concern.  
- Sibling components (**DMRManager**, **ProviderRegistryManager**) share the same provider catalogue but focus on registration and direct usage, illustrating a clear separation of responsibilities.  
- The child **CircuitBreakerConfigurator** encapsulates policy definition, enabling independent evolution of configuration without touching the manager’s core logic.  

### Scalability considerations  
- Adding new providers only requires registration in `lib/llm/provider-registry.js`; the manager automatically scales its monitoring to the new entries.  
- Circuit‑breaker state is maintained in‑memory per provider, which scales linearly with the number of providers—acceptable for the typical handful of LLM back‑ends but may need sharding if the catalogue grows dramatically.  
- Configuration parameters (timeouts, retry limits) can be tuned per provider to accommodate heterogeneous performance characteristics, supporting heterogeneous scaling.  

### Maintainability assessment  
- **High cohesion**: the manager’s sole purpose is resilience, making the codebase easier to reason about.  
- **Low coupling**: reliance on the ProviderRegistry interface abstracts away provider‑specific details, allowing providers to evolve independently.  
- **Extensible configurability** via **CircuitBreakerConfigurator** means policy changes do not require code modifications, reducing regression risk.  
- The lack of visible public APIs in the observations suggests a simple, well‑encapsulated interface, which further aids maintainability.  

Overall, **CircuitBreakerManager** introduces a robust, configurable safety net for the LLM abstraction layer while preserving clean separation of concerns and enabling straightforward scaling and maintenance.

## Hierarchy Context

### Parent
- [LLMAbstraction](./LLMAbstraction.md) -- The LLMAbstraction component's use of the ProviderRegistry class (lib/llm/provider-registry.js) allows for easy management of available LLM providers. This is evident in the way providers are registered and retrieved using the registerProvider and getProvider methods. For example, the DMRProvider class (lib/llm/providers/dmr-provider.ts) is registered as a provider, enabling local LLM inference via Docker Desktop's Model Runner. The ProviderRegistry class also enables the addition or removal of providers, making it a flexible and scalable solution. Furthermore, the use of the ProviderRegistry class promotes loose coupling between the LLMAbstraction component and the LLM providers, allowing for changes to be made to the providers without affecting the component.

### Children
- [CircuitBreakerConfigurator](./CircuitBreakerConfigurator.md) -- The CircuitBreakerConfigurator would likely define the timeout and retry policies in a configuration file, potentially in a separate module or class.

### Siblings
- [DMRManager](./DMRManager.md) -- DMRManager uses the DMRProvider class (lib/llm/providers/dmr-provider.ts) to register as a provider, enabling local LLM inference
- [ProviderRegistryManager](./ProviderRegistryManager.md) -- ProviderRegistryManager uses the ProviderRegistry class (lib/llm/provider-registry.js) to manage available LLM providers
