# DesignPatternManager

**Type:** SubComponent

DesignPatternManager relies on the CodeAnalysisModule, which uses the CodeGraphAgent in integrations/mcp-server-semantic-analysis/src/agents/code-graph-agent.ts, to analyze code based on stored design patterns.

## What It Is  

DesignPatternManager is a **SubComponent** that lives inside the **CodingPatterns** component.  Its concrete implementation is spread across the graph‑database adapter (`storage/graph-database-adapter.ts`) and the semantic‑analysis integration (`integrations/mcp-server-semantic-analysis/src/agents/code-graph-agent.ts`).  The manager’s primary responsibility is to **persist, retrieve, and apply design‑pattern knowledge**—including security standards and anti‑patterns—by treating each pattern as an entity in the underlying graph database.  It does this by invoking `GraphDatabaseAdapter.createEntity()` to store patterns and by exposing retrieval APIs that other modules (e.g., the CodeAnalysisModule, CodingConventionEnforcer, SecurityStandardsModule) can consume during code‑analysis workflows.

## Architecture and Design  

The observed architecture follows a **component‑centric, graph‑backed knowledge‑store** approach.  The **GraphDatabaseAdapter** acts as an *adapter* that abstracts the low‑level graph‑DB operations behind a simple `createEntity()` method, allowing DesignPatternManager to remain agnostic of the specific database technology.  DesignPatternManager itself is a *manager* façade that orchestrates pattern storage (via its child component **PatternStorage**) and pattern consumption (via the **CodeAnalysisModule**).  

Interaction between components is clearly **layered**:  
1. **PatternStorage** (child) calls `GraphDatabaseAdapter.createEntity()` to materialize a design‑pattern node.  
2. The **DesignPatternManager** aggregates these stored entities and provides lookup services to sibling components.  
3. The **CodeAnalysisModule**, which depends on the **CodeGraphAgent** (`integrations/mcp-server-semantic-analysis/src/agents/code-graph-agent.ts`), pulls the stored patterns from DesignPatternManager to enrich its semantic analysis.  

The parent **CodingPatterns** component shares the same graph‑database adapter, reinforcing a **shared‑resource** pattern where multiple sub‑components rely on a common persistence layer.  Sibling components such as **CodingConventionEnforcer** and **SecurityStandardsModule** consume the same pattern data, illustrating a **publish‑subscribe** style of data reuse without tightly coupling the consumers to the storage implementation.

## Implementation Details  

At the heart of the implementation is the **GraphDatabaseAdapter** class located in `storage/graph-database-adapter.ts`.  Its `createEntity()` method receives a plain‑object representation of a design pattern (name, description, category, metadata) and translates it into a graph node, handling any necessary indexing or relationship wiring.  **PatternStorage**, a child of DesignPatternManager, encapsulates the call to `createEntity()`, providing a focused API such as `storePattern(patternDto)` that validates input before persisting.  

DesignPatternManager exposes higher‑level operations like `getPatternById(id)`, `listAllPatterns()`, and `applyPatternsToCode(ast)`.  The latter delegates to the **CodeAnalysisModule**, which in turn uses the **CodeGraphAgent** (`integrations/mcp-server-semantic-analysis/src/agents/code-graph-agent.ts`).  The agent walks the code’s abstract syntax tree, queries the graph database for matching pattern entities, and annotates the AST with guidance (e.g., “replace this anti‑pattern with the recommended design pattern”).  

The **KnowledgeGraphManager** is another sibling that also uses `GraphDatabaseAdapter` to store broader knowledge‑graph data.  Because both managers rely on the same adapter, they benefit from a consistent transaction model and shared indexing strategy, reducing duplication of persistence logic.

## Integration Points  

DesignPatternManager sits at the nexus of several integration pathways:  

* **Storage Layer** – Directly depends on `GraphDatabaseAdapter.createEntity()` (and complementary read methods) in `storage/graph-database-adapter.ts`.  All pattern entities flow through this adapter, making it the sole persistence contract.  

* **Code Analysis Stack** – Supplies stored patterns to the **CodeAnalysisModule**, which invokes the **CodeGraphAgent** (`integrations/mcp-server-semantic-analysis/src/agents/code-graph-agent.ts`).  The agent acts as the bridge between the graph store and the code‑analysis runtime, translating pattern nodes into actionable rules.  

* **Sibling Consumers** – **CodingConventionEnforcer** and **SecurityStandardsModule** request patterns via DesignPatternManager’s public APIs to enforce coding conventions and security policies, respectively.  This decouples enforcement logic from pattern storage.  

* **Parent Component** – The **CodingPatterns** component coordinates the overall lifecycle of pattern data, ensuring that both DesignPatternManager and its siblings operate against a consistent graph schema.  

* **Child Component** – **PatternStorage** encapsulates the low‑level creation flow, exposing a clean, testable surface for persisting new patterns without exposing the adapter directly to higher layers.

## Usage Guidelines  

1. **Persist via PatternStorage** – When adding a new design pattern, always route the payload through the `PatternStorage` child component.  This guarantees that validation, metadata enrichment, and the `createEntity()` call are performed consistently.  

2. **Retrieve through DesignPatternManager** – Consumers such as **CodingConventionEnforcer** or **SecurityStandardsModule** should call the manager’s read APIs (`getPatternById`, `listAllPatterns`) rather than accessing the graph adapter directly.  This preserves the abstraction barrier and protects future schema changes.  

3. **Leverage CodeAnalysisModule for application** – To apply stored patterns to source code, invoke the manager’s `applyPatternsToCode(ast)` method.  This method internally uses the **CodeGraphAgent**, so callers do not need to manage graph queries themselves.  

4. **Respect shared adapter usage** – Because **KnowledgeGraphManager**, **CodeGraphAgent**, and DesignPatternManager all share `GraphDatabaseAdapter`, any changes to the adapter’s contract (e.g., method signatures, transaction semantics) must be coordinated across these components to avoid breaking the shared persistence layer.  

5. **Version patterns thoughtfully** – Since patterns are stored as graph entities, adding version metadata is advisable.  Consumers can then request a specific version, enabling gradual migration of code bases without abrupt rule changes.

### 1. Architectural patterns identified  
* **Adapter pattern** – `GraphDatabaseAdapter` abstracts the graph‑DB implementation.  
* **Manager façade** – `DesignPatternManager` provides a unified interface for pattern storage and retrieval.  
* **Component‑based composition** – Parent (`CodingPatterns`), sibling, and child (`PatternStorage`) components interact through well‑defined contracts.  
* **Shared‑resource (common persistence) pattern** – Multiple components rely on the same graph‑DB adapter.

### 2. Design decisions and trade‑offs  
* **Centralising pattern data in a graph database** gives rich relationship queries but introduces a dependency on graph‑DB performance and operational complexity.  
* **Separating storage (PatternStorage) from orchestration (DesignPatternManager)** improves testability but adds an extra indirection layer.  
* **Using a single adapter for all knowledge‑graph interactions** reduces code duplication but couples unrelated domains (design patterns vs. code‑analysis data) to the same persistence API.

### 3. System structure insights  
* The system is organised as a hierarchy: `CodingPatterns` → `DesignPatternManager` → `PatternStorage`.  
* Sibling components (`CodingConventionEnforcer`, `SecurityStandardsModule`, `CodeAnalysisFramework`) consume the same pattern data, illustrating a **data‑centric** rather than **service‑centric** architecture.  
* The **CodeGraphAgent** acts as the integration point between the graph store and runtime code analysis, reinforcing a clear separation between data storage and analysis execution.

### 4. Scalability considerations  
* **Graph‑DB scaling** – As the number of stored patterns and their relationships grow, indexing strategies and sharding become critical.  
* **Read‑heavy workloads** – Retrieval through DesignPatternManager is read‑biased; caching frequently used patterns at the manager level could reduce graph‑DB load.  
* **Concurrent writes** – `createEntity()` must handle concurrent pattern submissions; transaction isolation in the adapter is essential to avoid duplicate nodes.

### 5. Maintainability assessment  
* **High cohesion** – PatternStorage focuses solely on persistence, while DesignPatternManager handles orchestration, making each unit easy to reason about.  
* **Loose coupling** – Consumers interact through manager APIs, shielding them from underlying storage changes.  
* **Potential fragility** – Shared use of `GraphDatabaseAdapter` means that a breaking change to the adapter propagates to all dependent components; versioned adapters or interface segregation could mitigate this risk.  
* **Documentation clarity** – The explicit naming of paths and classes in the observations provides a strong anchor for future developers to locate implementation details quickly.

## Hierarchy Context

### Parent
- [CodingPatterns](./CodingPatterns.md) -- The CodingPatterns component utilizes the GraphDatabaseAdapter class, specifically the createEntity() method in storage/graph-database-adapter.ts, to store design patterns as entities in the graph database. This facilitates the persistence and retrieval of coding conventions. For instance, when storing security standards and anti-patterns as entities, the GraphDatabaseAdapter.createEntity() method is deployed. This enables comprehensive coding guidance and is a key aspect of the component's architecture. The CodeAnalysisModule, which uses the CodeGraphAgent in integrations/mcp-server-semantic-analysis/src/agents/code-graph-agent.ts, relies on these stored patterns to analyze code.

### Children
