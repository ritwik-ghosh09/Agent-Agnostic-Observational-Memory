# DatabaseConfiguration

**Type:** Detail

The lack of explicit source files for the GraphDatabaseAdapter implies that database configuration might be defined in a separate module or file, which is not shown in the provided source files.

## What It Is  

`DatabaseConfiguration` is the concrete configuration holder that supplies the connection and operational parameters required by the **GraphDatabaseAdapter**. The adapter lives in `storage/graph-database-adapter.ts`, and it relies on `DatabaseConfiguration` to know *which* graph database instance to talk to, how to authenticate, and how to tune runtime behaviour such as batch processing. Although no source file for `DatabaseConfiguration` is listed among the provided symbols, the observations make it clear that the configuration is a distinct module that is consumed by the adapter (and, by extension, by higher‑level components such as the **ContentValidationModule** and the **LLMServiceManager**). One explicitly documented constant, `MEMGRAPH_BATCH_SIZE`, lives in the project documentation and signals that batch size is a first‑class configuration concern for the adapter.

## Architecture and Design  

The architecture follows a **modular, separation‑of‑concerns** approach. `GraphDatabaseAdapter` encapsulates all low‑level graph‑database interactions, while `DatabaseConfiguration` abstracts the environment‑specific details (endpoint URLs, credentials, batch sizes, time‑outs, etc.). This split mirrors a classic *Adapter* pattern paired with a *Configuration* object, allowing the adapter to remain agnostic of where the values originate.  

Sibling components such as `GraphDatabaseConfiguration` (listed twice, likely a duplication in the hierarchy description) and `DatabaseConnectionManager` reinforce the same design intent: centralising database‑related settings and connection lifecycles. The presence of a dedicated `DatabaseConnectionManager` suggests that connection pooling or lifecycle management is handled outside the adapter, further decoupling resource handling from business logic.  

The interaction flow can be summarised as:  

1. **ContentValidationModule** (or any consumer) invokes the `GraphDatabaseAdapter`.  
2. The adapter reads its required settings from `DatabaseConfiguration`.  
3. It hands the resolved parameters to `DatabaseConnectionManager`, which creates or re‑uses a connection to the graph store.  
4. Operations such as pre‑populating ontology metadata fields are executed, honouring the `MEMGRAPH_BATCH_SIZE` to control write throughput.  

This layered design enables each module to evolve independently—changing the batch size, swapping the underlying graph engine, or adjusting connection handling can be done without touching the adapter’s core logic.

## Implementation Details  

Even though the concrete file for `DatabaseConfiguration` is not enumerated, the observations imply the following technical mechanics:

* **Configuration Container** – Likely a class or plain object named `DatabaseConfiguration` that exposes properties such as `host`, `port`, `username`, `password`, and the documented `MEMGRAPH_BATCH_SIZE`. The naming convention (`MEMGRAPH_…`) hints that the system targets a Memgraph instance, but the container is generic enough to support other graph databases if needed.  

* **Static or Environment‑Driven Values** – Given the importance of batch size, `MEMGRAPH_BATCH_SIZE` is probably read from an environment variable or a JSON/YAML config file at application start‑up, allowing operators to tune it without recompiling.  

* **Dependency Injection** – The fact that `GraphDatabaseAdapter` *contains* `DatabaseConfiguration` suggests that the adapter receives an instance of the configuration (or a reference to a singleton) via its constructor or a setter method. This pattern makes the adapter testable: unit tests can inject mock configurations with different batch sizes to verify behaviour.  

* **Batch Processing Logic** – Inside the adapter (in `storage/graph-database-adapter.ts`), write operations are likely split into chunks of `MEMGRAPH_BATCH_SIZE`. This prevents overwhelming the graph engine and aligns with Memgraph’s recommended bulk‑load practices. The adapter therefore iterates over the data set, sending each chunk through the connection provided by `DatabaseConnectionManager`.  

* **Error Handling & Retries** – While not explicitly mentioned, a robust adapter would catch errors from the connection manager, possibly retrying failed batches based on configuration flags (e.g., `maxRetries`). Such behaviour would be driven by additional fields in `DatabaseConfiguration`.  

Overall, `DatabaseConfiguration` acts as the single source of truth for all runtime parameters that dictate how the adapter interacts with the graph store.

## Integration Points  

`DatabaseConfiguration` sits at the nexus of several system components:

* **ContentValidationModule** – Calls into `GraphDatabaseAdapter` to pre‑populate ontology metadata. The module indirectly depends on the configuration for correct endpoint resolution and batch sizing.  

* **LLMServiceManager** – Uses the same `GraphDatabaseAdapter` (and thus the same configuration) to store and retrieve large‑language‑model artefacts. Consistency of configuration across these consumers ensures that both validation and service‑level data share the same database instance and performance characteristics.  

* **DatabaseConnectionManager** – Receives the concrete connection parameters from `DatabaseConfiguration`. This manager likely abstracts pooling, reconnection logic, and low‑level driver initialisation.  

* **Deployment / Ops Layer** – Because `MEMGRAPH_BATCH_SIZE` is documented, operators can adjust it via environment variables or external config files without modifying code. This externalisation is a key integration point for CI/CD pipelines and infrastructure‑as‑code tools.  

All interactions are contract‑based: the adapter expects a configuration object that conforms to a known interface (e.g., `DatabaseConfigInterface`). The siblings `GraphDatabaseConfiguration` and `DatabaseConnectionManager` share this contract, promoting reuse and reducing duplication.

## Usage Guidelines  

1. **Centralise All Database Settings** – Populate `DatabaseConfiguration` in a single location (environment file, secret manager, or dedicated config module). Do not scatter connection strings or batch sizes across the codebase.  

2. **Respect the Batch Size** – When invoking the `GraphDatabaseAdapter` for bulk writes, rely on the adapter’s internal batching driven by `MEMGRAPH_BATCH_SIZE`. Avoid manual chunking in callers; doing so can lead to duplicate effort and inconsistent performance.  

3. **Leverage Dependency Injection for Testability** – In unit tests, inject a mock `DatabaseConfiguration` with a small `MEMGRAPH_BATCH_SIZE` (e.g., `1`) to exercise edge cases without overwhelming a test database.  

4. **Do Not Hard‑Code Credentials** – Keep sensitive fields (username, password, TLS certificates) out of source files. The configuration object should retrieve them from secure stores at runtime.  

5. **Monitor and Tune** – Observe throughput and latency in production. If the graph database shows back‑pressure, increase `MEMGRAPH_BATCH_SIZE` gradually; if memory pressure occurs, decrease it. Because the value is externalised, tuning does not require a code change.  

6. **Version the Configuration Schema** – If new parameters are added (e.g., `readTimeoutMs`), version the `DatabaseConfiguration` interface to avoid breaking existing adapters.

### Architectural patterns identified  

* Adapter pattern (GraphDatabaseAdapter)  
* Configuration object pattern (DatabaseConfiguration)  
* Separation of concerns / modular design  
* Implicit dependency injection  

### Design decisions and trade‑offs  

* **Explicit configuration vs. hard‑coded values** – Improves flexibility and ops control but adds a discovery overhead when the config file is not co‑located with the adapter.  
* **Batch size as a configurable constant** – Enables performance tuning but requires operators to understand the impact on memory and network usage.  
* **Separate connection manager** – Decouples lifecycle management from business logic, at the cost of an additional abstraction layer.  

### System structure insights  

* `DatabaseConfiguration` is a leaf node in the configuration hierarchy but a root of runtime behaviour for all graph‑database interactions.  
* Siblings (`GraphDatabaseConfiguration`, `DatabaseConnectionManager`) share the same configuration contract, reinforcing a cohesive database subsystem.  

### Scalability considerations  

* The `MEMGRAPH_BATCH_SIZE` directly influences write throughput; scaling out to larger data loads is primarily a matter of increasing this value while ensuring the underlying Memgraph instance can handle larger transaction sizes.  
* Because the adapter obtains connections from a manager, horizontal scaling (multiple adapter instances) can be achieved without code changes, provided the configuration points to a cluster‑aware endpoint.  

### Maintainability assessment  

* **High maintainability** – Centralised configuration and clear module boundaries make updates straightforward.  
* **Potential discoverability issue** – The lack of a visible source file for `DatabaseConfiguration` could hinder new developers; documentation should explicitly point to its location.  
* **Testability is strong** – Dependency injection of the configuration enables isolated unit tests.  

Overall, `DatabaseConfiguration` embodies a disciplined, configuration‑driven approach that underpins reliable, tunable interaction with the graph database across the system.
