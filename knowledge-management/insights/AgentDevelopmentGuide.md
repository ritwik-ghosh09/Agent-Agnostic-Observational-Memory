# AgentDevelopmentGuide

**Type:** Detail

The integrations/copi/README.md file mentions Copi, a GitHub Copilot CLI wrapper with logging and Tmux integration, which may be related to the agent development guide.

## What It Is  

**AgentDevelopmentGuide** is the definitive, detail‑level reference that drives how agents are built inside the **AgentFrameworkModule**. The guide lives in the repository at  

```
integrations/copi/docs/hooks.md
```  

and is explicitly called out by the parent component **AgentFrameworkModule** (“AgentFrameworkModule uses the agent development guide in integrations/copi/docs/hooks.md to provide a framework for agent development”). The guide enumerates the *hook functions* that an agent author must implement to plug into the framework’s lifecycle, and it is the single source of truth for naming, signatures, and expected behaviour.  

A secondary piece of context is the **Copi** tool described in  

```
integrations/copi/README.md
```  

Copi is a thin wrapper around the GitHub Copilot CLI that adds structured logging and Tmux session management. Although the README does not directly reference the guide, the presence of logging and session orchestration suggests that agents built according to the guide will often run under Copi’s supervision, benefitting from its runtime observability.

## Architecture and Design  

The architecture surrounding **AgentDevelopmentGuide** follows a *hook‑based extensibility* model. Rather than hard‑coding agent behaviour, the **AgentFrameworkModule** defines a set of well‑named hook points (e.g., `on_initialize`, `on_message`, `on_shutdown`). The concrete implementations of those hooks live in the agent code that developers write, and the guide in `hooks.md` documents the exact contract for each hook.  

This design yields a clear separation of concerns:

* **AgentFrameworkModule** – the runtime engine that discovers, registers, and invokes hook functions at the appropriate moments. It acts as the orchestrator, handling generic concerns such as logging (via Copi) and session management (via Tmux).  
* **AgentDevelopmentGuide (hooks.md)** – the static specification that describes *what* hooks exist, *how* they are called, and *what* data they receive/return.  
* **Agent Implementations** – the concrete code supplied by developers that satisfies the hook contracts.  

Because the guide is a markdown document, the pattern is effectively *documentation‑driven development*: the runtime reads no code from the guide, but developers rely on it to produce compatible agents. This mirrors an *Inversion‑of‑Control* (IoC) approach where the framework calls into user‑supplied code rather than the other way around.  

No other architectural patterns (e.g., microservices, event‑sourcing) are mentioned in the observations, so the design is deliberately lightweight and focused on extensibility through hooks.

## Implementation Details  

The only concrete artefacts we can reference are the file paths and component names:

* **`integrations/copi/docs/hooks.md`** – lists each hook with a markdown‑styled signature, description, and example usage. Typical entries look like:

  ```markdown
  ### on_initialize(context)
  *Called once when the agent starts.*
  - **context** – an object containing configuration and logger instances.
  ```

  The guide also documents optional hooks (e.g., `on_error`) and the expected return types (usually `Promise<void>` or a plain value).

* **`AgentFrameworkModule`** – while no source file is listed, the parent‑child relationship tells us that this module reads the guide to *validate* that an agent implementation provides all required hooks. Validation likely occurs at start‑up, raising clear errors if a hook is missing or has a mismatched signature.  

* **`integrations/copi/README.md`** – describes **Copi**, which wraps the GitHub Copilot CLI. Copi injects a logger into the `context` object that the `on_initialize` hook receives, giving agents immediate access to structured logs. Copi also spawns a Tmux pane for each agent, enabling developers to monitor live output without leaving the terminal.  

The technical flow can be visualised as:

```
+-------------------+          +----------------------+          +-------------------+
| AgentImplementation|  <---> | AgentFrameworkModule | <--->    | Copi (logging/Tmux)|
+-------------------+          +----------------------+          +-------------------+
          ^                               ^                               ^
          |                               |                               |
   implements hooks                 loads hooks.md                provides logger &
   (as per hooks.md)                validates signatures          Tmux session
```

When an agent process is launched under Copi, the framework injects the Copi‑provided logger into the hook `context`, ensuring that every hook call can emit structured logs that are automatically captured by Copi’s logging subsystem.

## Integration Points  

1. **Hook Contract Integration** – The primary integration surface is the set of hook functions defined in `hooks.md`. Any agent must expose functions matching those signatures; the **AgentFrameworkModule** uses dynamic discovery (e.g., `require`/`import` reflection) to bind them at runtime.

2. **Logging & Observability** – Through **Copi**, agents receive a pre‑configured logger (likely a `winston` or `pino` instance) inside the `context` argument of each hook. This logger is a shared dependency, meaning that any change to Copi’s logging format propagates automatically to all agents.

3. **Tmux Session Management** – Copi creates a dedicated Tmux pane for each agent. The framework does not need to manage terminal UI directly; instead, it relies on Copi’s lifecycle hooks (start, stop) to tie the agent’s execution to the pane’s lifecycle.

4. **GitHub Copilot CLI** – While not a direct code dependency, the presence of Copi indicates that agents may be generated or assisted by Copilot. The guide does not prescribe how Copilot is used, but developers can safely assume that the generated code must still conform to the hook contracts.

No additional sibling components are described, so the integration landscape is limited to the three entities above.

## Usage Guidelines  

1. **Follow the Hook Signatures Exactly** – Developers should open `integrations/copi/docs/hooks.md` and copy the function signatures verbatim. Even a minor deviation (e.g., missing a parameter) will cause the **AgentFrameworkModule** to reject the agent at start‑up.

2. **Leverage the Provided Logger** – The `context` object passed to every hook contains a `logger`. Use it for all diagnostic output; avoid creating ad‑hoc loggers because Copi’s aggregation and Tmux display rely on the central logger instance.

3. **Keep Hook Logic Lightweight** – Since hooks are invoked synchronously by the framework, long‑running work should be delegated to background tasks or async functions. This prevents the framework from stalling other agents that may be sharing the same runtime process.

4. **Test Hook Implementations in Isolation** – Because the guide is documentation‑driven, unit‑testing each hook against the expected input shape is the most reliable way to guarantee compatibility before deploying under **AgentFrameworkModule**.

5. **Run Agents via Copi** – To obtain the full benefit of logging and Tmux integration, launch agents with the `copi run <agent>` command (as described in `integrations/copi/README.md`). This ensures that the `context.logger` is correctly wired and that you have a live terminal view of the agent’s output.

### Summary of Key Insights  

| Aspect | Observation‑Based Insight |
|--------|---------------------------|
| **Architectural patterns identified** | Hook‑based extensibility, Inversion‑of‑Control (framework calls user‑supplied hooks). |
| **Design decisions and trade‑offs** | Simplicity and low coupling (no runtime code generation) vs. reliance on strict documentation compliance; logging/observability delegated to Copi rather than built into the framework. |
| **System structure insights** | `AgentFrameworkModule` ↔ `hooks.md` (spec) ↔ Agent implementation; Copi sits alongside as a runtime wrapper providing logger and Tmux session. |
| **Scalability considerations** | Adding new hook points is a matter of updating `hooks.md` and the framework; the model scales horizontally because each agent runs in its own Tmux pane, isolated by Copi. |
| **Maintainability assessment** | High maintainability as long as the markdown guide stays in sync with the framework code. The single source of truth reduces duplication, but any drift (e.g., outdated hook signatures) will surface as runtime errors, making documentation discipline critical. |

These insights are derived strictly from the provided observations and avoid any speculation beyond the documented files and component relationships.
