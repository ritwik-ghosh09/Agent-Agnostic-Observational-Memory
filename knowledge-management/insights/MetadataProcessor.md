# MetadataProcessor

**Type:** SubComponent

The MetadataProcessor is a crucial part of the Trajectory component, as it enables the logging of relevant metadata.

## What It Is  

**MetadataProcessor** is a sub‑component that lives inside the **Trajectory** component. All of the concrete interactions that have been observed happen through the **SpecstoryAdapter** class located in `lib/integrations/specstory-adapter.js`. The processor’s sole responsibility is to take raw project‑ and session‑level information supplied by the Specstory extension, transform it into a structured “metadata” payload, and hand that payload to the **LoggingManager** for persistent logging. In practice the flow looks like this: the SpecstoryAdapter receives raw data, invokes the MetadataProcessor, the processor normalises the data (e.g., extracts project name, session id, timestamps, and any custom tags), and then calls the LoggingManager’s logging API. Because the Trajectory component depends on accurate logging for later analysis, the MetadataProcessor is described as “crucial” to the overall behavior of the component.

## Architecture and Design  

The architecture surrounding MetadataProcessor is **layered** and **co‑ordinated through explicit adapters**. The SpecstoryAdapter acts as the integration point between an external Specstory extension and the internal logging pipeline. Within that adapter, a **retry‑with‑backoff** strategy is employed for the `connectViaHTTP` method (see `lib/integrations/specstory-adapter.js`). While the retry logic belongs to the connection handling concern, it indirectly benefits MetadataProcessor because it guarantees that the metadata it prepares will eventually reach the LoggingManager even when the network is flaky.  

The design follows a **separation‑of‑concerns** pattern:  
1. **SpecstoryAdapter** – handles external communication, error‑recovery, and initial receipt of raw data.  
2. **MetadataProcessor** – pure data‑transformation logic, isolated from transport or persistence details.  
3. **LoggingManager** – centralised logging service that persists the processed metadata.  

These three pieces interact via **well‑defined interfaces**: the adapter calls a method on MetadataProcessor (e.g., `processMetadata(raw)`) and the processor returns a structured object that the adapter then passes to LoggingManager (e.g., `LoggingManager.log(metadata)`). No direct coupling exists between MetadataProcessor and the HTTP connection code, which keeps the processor testable and reusable.

## Implementation Details  

Even though the source repository does not expose concrete symbols for MetadataProcessor, the observations give a clear functional picture. The processor consumes **project information** (such as project ID, name, version) and **session information** (session ID, start/end timestamps, user context). It likely performs the following steps internally:

1. **Extraction** – pulls the required fields from the raw payload supplied by SpecstoryAdapter.  
2. **Normalization** – converts values to a canonical shape (e.g., ISO‑8601 timestamps, lower‑cased identifiers).  
3. **Enrichment** – may add derived fields such as a “run‑hash” or combine project‑level defaults with session‑level overrides.  
4. **Packaging** – assembles the final metadata object that matches the schema expected by LoggingManager.

The processor’s output is then handed back to the SpecstoryAdapter, which immediately invokes `LoggingManager.log(metadata)` (the exact method name is not disclosed but the intent is clear from the observations). Because the processor is invoked *before* logging, any failure in its transformation logic would prevent LoggingManager from receiving a payload, making robust error handling inside the processor essential.

## Integration Points  

- **Parent – Trajectory**: Trajectory owns the MetadataProcessor. All logging that Trajectory performs about trajectory execution (e.g., path calculations, waypoint updates) first passes through the processor to ensure a uniform metadata shape.  
- **Sibling – LoggingManager**: The processor supplies the processed metadata to LoggingManager. LoggingManager is the central sink for all logs, and it expects the metadata in the exact format produced by the processor.  
- **Sibling – ConnectionHandler**: While not directly called by MetadataProcessor, ConnectionHandler shares the same SpecstoryAdapter and benefits from the same retry‑with‑backoff logic. This shared adapter means that any improvement to connection resilience automatically improves the reliability of metadata delivery.  
- **External – SpecstoryAdapter (`lib/integrations/specstory-adapter.js`)**: The adapter is the entry point for raw metadata. It is responsible for calling the processor and then forwarding the result to LoggingManager. The adapter also logs the same metadata (project and session info) as part of its own diagnostics, reinforcing the importance of a single source of truth for metadata.

## Usage Guidelines  

1. **Treat MetadataProcessor as a pure function** – callers (typically SpecstoryAdapter) should pass immutable raw objects and expect a new, fully‑populated metadata object in return. Avoid mutating the input payload after it has been handed to the processor.  
2. **Validate input early** – because the processor is the gatekeeper for logging, any missing required fields (project ID, session ID) should be detected and surfaced as errors before the LoggingManager is invoked.  
3. **Do not embed network logic** – keep retry‑with‑backoff or any HTTP concerns inside SpecstoryAdapter or ConnectionHandler. The processor must remain agnostic of transport mechanisms to stay testable.  
4. **Maintain schema consistency** – any change to the metadata schema (adding new fields, renaming existing ones) must be coordinated with LoggingManager’s expectations, otherwise logs may become unreadable downstream.  
5. **Unit‑test transformation paths** – given that the processor is a deterministic transformer, unit tests should cover all permutations of project and session data (including edge cases like missing optional tags).

### 1. Architectural patterns identified  
* **Layered architecture** – distinct layers for integration (SpecstoryAdapter), transformation (MetadataProcessor), and persistence (LoggingManager).  
* **Adapter pattern** – SpecstoryAdapter abstracts the external Specstory extension and presents a clean interface to the internal components.  
* **Separation of concerns** – each component handles a single responsibility (connection handling, metadata processing, logging).  
* **Retry‑with‑backoff** – employed by SpecstoryAdapter for resilient HTTP connections, indirectly supporting the processor’s reliability.

### 2. Design decisions and trade‑offs  
* **Isolation of processing logic** keeps the processor lightweight and easy to test, but it requires a well‑defined contract with both the adapter and the logging service.  
* **Relying on the adapter for error‑recovery** simplifies the processor but couples its success to the adapter’s ability to retry; if the adapter fails, the processor’s output never reaches LoggingManager.  
* **Centralised logging via LoggingManager** ensures a single source of truth for logs, at the cost of a tighter dependency on the manager’s schema stability.

### 3. System structure insights  
* The **Trajectory** component is the top‑level owner of the logging pipeline; its child **MetadataProcessor** is the transformation hub.  
* **LoggingManager** and **ConnectionHandler** sit as siblings, sharing the same adapter and thus a common error‑handling strategy.  
* The overall system forms a **pipeline**: External Specstory → SpecstoryAdapter (connect + retry) → MetadataProcessor (transform) → LoggingManager (persist).

### 4. Scalability considerations  
* Because the processor is stateless and purely functional, it can be scaled horizontally (multiple instances can run in parallel) without contention.  
* The bottleneck is likely the **LoggingManager** or the underlying storage; ensuring that LoggingManager can handle high‑throughput writes is essential for scaling the metadata pipeline.  
* The retry‑with‑backoff logic in SpecstoryAdapter protects against transient spikes in network latency, helping the pipeline remain stable under load.

### 5. Maintainability assessment  
* **High maintainability** – the clear separation of responsibilities means changes to one layer (e.g., adding a new metadata field) are localized.  
* The lack of direct coupling to transport code reduces the surface area for bugs.  
* However, the implicit contract between MetadataProcessor and LoggingManager must be documented and versioned; any drift can cause silent logging failures. Regular integration tests that exercise the full pipeline (SpecstoryAdapter → MetadataProcessor → LoggingManager) will mitigate this risk.

## Hierarchy Context

### Parent
- [Trajectory](./Trajectory.md) -- The Trajectory component's use of retry-with-backoff in the connectViaHTTP method of the SpecstoryAdapter class (lib/integrations/specstory-adapter.js) demonstrates a robust approach to handling connection attempts. This pattern allows the component to recover from temporary failures and maintain a stable connection with the Specstory extension. The implementation of this pattern is crucial in ensuring the component's reliability, especially in scenarios where network connectivity might be unstable. Furthermore, the SpecstoryAdapter class's logging functionality, which includes metadata such as project and session information, provides valuable insights into the component's behavior and facilitates debugging.

### Siblings
- [LoggingManager](./LoggingManager.md) -- The SpecstoryAdapter class in lib/integrations/specstory-adapter.js uses the LoggingManager to log metadata such as project and session information.
- [ConnectionHandler](./ConnectionHandler.md) -- The ConnectionHandler uses a retry-with-backoff pattern in the connectViaHTTP method of the SpecstoryAdapter class to establish a stable connection.
