# Integrations

**Type:** SubComponent

The integrations/copi/docs/SEND-VULNERABILITY-EMAILS.md file provides guidelines for sending vulnerability update emails, which is an example of an integration

## What It Is  

The **Integrations** sub‑component lives under the `integrations/` directory of the repository and is a curated collection of ready‑to‑run examples that show how the broader platform can be extended or hooked into external workflows.  Each integration is represented by its own folder and a top‑level `README.md` that explains purpose, setup, and runtime behavior.  The current catalog includes:

* `integrations/browser-access/README.md` – the **Browser Access MCP Server** example for Claude Code.  
* `integrations/code-graph-rag/README.md` – a **graph‑code Retrieval‑Augmented Generation (RAG)** system.  
* `integrations/copi/README.md` together with a rich set of supporting docs (`USAGE.md`, `docs/SEND‑VULNERABILITY‑EMAILS.md`, `docs/DELETE‑WORKSPACES‑README.md`, `docs/STATUS‑LINE‑QUICK‑REFERENCE.md`, `docs/hooks.md`).  
* `integrations/mcp-constraint-monitor/README.md` – the **MCP constraint monitor** integration.

These folders are concrete manifestations of the “Integrations” concept: self‑contained, documented, and runnable pieces of functionality that illustrate how the platform can be wired into other services, UI layers, or operational pipelines.  The sub‑component is itself a child of the **CodingPatterns** component, which houses a family of reusable patterns across the codebase.

## Architecture and Design  

The architecture of **Integrations** is deliberately *modular* and *example‑driven*.  Each integration lives in its own top‑level directory (`integrations/<name>/`) and follows a consistent layout: a primary `README.md` that acts as the entry point, optional usage guides, and ancillary documentation files.  This directory‑per‑integration pattern makes it trivial to add, remove, or evolve an integration without touching the others, supporting a low‑coupling, high‑cohesion design.

Although the observations do not expose explicit class or function definitions, the surrounding hierarchy gives clues about the design philosophy.  The parent **CodingPatterns** component employs a hook‑loading system (`lib/agent‑api/hooks/hook‑config.js` → `HookConfigLoader`) and lazy LLM initialization (`ensureLLMInitialized()` in `base‑agent.ts`).  The **Integrations** sub‑component inherits this philosophy: the Copi integration, for instance, provides `docs/hooks.md` that describes hook functions used throughout the integration.  This indicates that each integration is expected to plug into the same hook infrastructure defined at the parent level, preserving a common extension point across the ecosystem.

The design also emphasizes *documentation‑first* delivery.  Every integration ships with multiple markdown files that describe operational procedures (e.g., sending vulnerability emails, deleting workspaces, status‑line usage).  This reflects a pattern where the integration’s runtime logic is accompanied by prescriptive operational guides, reducing the cognitive load for developers who adopt the integration.

## Implementation Details  

### Browser Access MCP Server  
*Path:* `integrations/browser-access/README.md`  
The README explains that this integration implements a **Browser Access MCP Server** for Claude Code.  While no source files are listed, the description suggests a server process that mediates browser‑based interactions with the MCP (Model‑Control‑Plane).  The integration likely exports a start‑up script or entry point that can be launched locally or in a container, exposing HTTP endpoints for browser clients.

### Code‑Graph RAG  
*Path:* `integrations/code-graph-rag/README.md`  
This integration demonstrates a **graph‑code Retrieval‑Augmented Generation** pipeline.  The README would normally detail how source code is indexed into a graph structure, how queries are transformed into graph traversals, and how the results are fed to an LLM for answer generation.  The implementation probably includes a graph database client, a query builder, and a thin wrapper that calls the LLM API.

### Copi Integration Suite  
*Path:* `integrations/copi/`  
The Copi folder is the most extensive, containing:

* `USAGE.md` – high‑level usage instructions, likely covering installation, configuration, and basic commands.  
* `docs/hooks.md` – a reference for hook functions, indicating that Copi registers or consumes hooks defined by the parent **CodingPatterns** system.  
* `docs/SEND‑VULNERABILITY‑EMAILS.md` – a procedural guide for emitting vulnerability update emails, implying the presence of an email‑dispatch module or service client.  
* `docs/DELETE‑WORKSPACES‑README.md` – steps for safely removing workspaces, which suggests file‑system or cloud‑resource cleanup logic.  
* `docs/STATUS‑LINE‑QUICK‑REFERENCE.md` – a cheat‑sheet for status‑line integration, hinting at a UI component that renders real‑time status information.

Collectively these docs point to a multi‑faceted integration that touches notification pipelines, resource lifecycle management, and UI status reporting.  The presence of a dedicated `hooks.md` file confirms that Copi leverages the hook mechanism introduced by **CodingPatterns**, allowing it to react to platform events (e.g., “workspace created”, “vulnerability detected”).

### MCP Constraint Monitor  
*Path:* `integrations/mcp-constraint-monitor/README.md`  
This integration monitors constraints within the MCP environment.  The README likely describes the metrics or rules being observed, the monitoring interval, and the alerting mechanisms (e.g., logs, webhook calls).  The implementation would involve a background process that queries MCP state and evaluates it against predefined constraints.

## Integration Points  

The **Integrations** sub‑component does not exist in isolation; it is wired into the broader platform through several explicit and implicit interfaces:

1. **Hook System** – The `docs/hooks.md` file inside the Copi integration references hook functions.  These hooks are defined and loaded by the `HookConfigLoader` class (`lib/agent-api/hooks/hook-config.js`) in the parent **CodingPatterns** component.  By adhering to this contract, each integration can subscribe to lifecycle events (initialization, execution, teardown) without hard‑coding dependencies.

2. **LLM Lazy Initialization** – The parent’s `ensureLLMInitialized()` method (`base-agent.ts`) suggests that any integration that requires LLM access (e.g., the Code‑Graph RAG integration) will benefit from the same lazy‑load pattern, avoiding unnecessary resource consumption until a request arrives.

3. **External Services** – The Copi integration’s vulnerability‑email guide (`SEND‑VULNERABILITY‑EMAILS.md`) and workspace deletion guide (`DELETE‑WORKSPACES‑README.md`) imply connections to an email service provider and a storage or cloud‑resource manager, respectively.  These are external dependencies that the integration must configure (SMTP credentials, cloud API keys).

4. **Browser UI Layer** – The Browser Access MCP Server provides a HTTP API consumed by a browser UI, acting as a bridge between front‑end code and the MCP back‑end.  This integration therefore exports network endpoints that other front‑end components can call.

5. **Monitoring & Alerting** – The MCP Constraint Monitor likely publishes metrics to a monitoring stack (Prometheus, Grafana) or pushes alerts via webhook, integrating with the observability ecosystem of the platform.

All of these points are documented in the respective `README.md` or supporting markdown files, ensuring that developers can locate the exact contract surface for each integration.

## Usage Guidelines  

1. **Read the Integration‑Specific README First** – Every integration ships with a top‑level `README.md` that outlines prerequisites, environment variables, and startup commands.  Treat this as the canonical source of truth before attempting to run any code.

2. **Respect Hook Contracts** – When extending or customizing an integration (e.g., adding a new Copi hook), follow the patterns described in `integrations/copi/docs/hooks.md`.  Register the hook in the configuration file that `HookConfigLoader` consumes, ensuring the system can merge it with existing hooks safely.

3. **Configure External Dependencies Explicitly** – For integrations that interact with email services, cloud storage, or monitoring back‑ends, provide the required credentials via environment variables or a dedicated config file.  The procedural guides (`SEND‑VULNERABILITY‑EMAILS.md`, `DELETE‑WORKSPACES‑README.md`) list the exact variable names and expected formats.

4. **Leverage Lazy Initialization** – Do not manually instantiate LLM clients inside an integration.  Instead, call the platform’s `ensureLLMInitialized()` (exposed through the base agent) so that the LLM is only started when needed, preserving resources.

5. **Maintain Documentation Parity** – Whenever you modify an integration’s behavior, update the corresponding markdown files.  The design of the **Integrations** sub‑component assumes that operational knowledge lives alongside code, so stale docs quickly become a source of confusion.

6. **Testing in Isolation** – Because each integration lives in its own directory, you can spin up a single integration (e.g., `npm run start:browser-access`) without pulling in the rest of the codebase.  Use this to validate changes locally before committing.

### Architectural patterns identified  

* **Modular per‑integration directory structure** – each integration is encapsulated in its own folder with self‑contained documentation.  
* **Hook‑based extensibility** – integrations consume and register hooks via the `HookConfigLoader` mechanism defined in the parent **CodingPatterns** component.  
* **Documentation‑driven design** – operational procedures are codified in markdown files that sit next to the code, encouraging a “docs as code” pattern.  

### Design decisions and trade‑offs  

* **Isolation vs. Duplication** – Keeping each integration isolated reduces coupling but can lead to duplicated setup scripts or configuration schemas across integrations.  
* **Explicit docs vs. Implicit code contracts** – Relying heavily on markdown for usage contracts makes onboarding easier but places runtime validation outside the code, risking drift if docs are not kept up‑to‑date.  
* **Hook reliance** – Using a shared hook loader centralizes event handling but introduces a single point of failure; if the hook loader misbehaves, all integrations that depend on it are impacted.  

### System structure insights  

The **Integrations** sub‑component sits under **CodingPatterns**, indicating that integrations are considered a pattern of extending the core platform.  Sibling components such as **DesignPatterns**, **CodingConventions**, and **DevelopmentPractices** share the same philosophy of “pattern + documentation”, reinforcing a consistent engineering culture.  The child **BrowserAccessMcpServer** demonstrates that a concrete integration can be further broken down into its own sub‑entity, suggesting a hierarchy where complex integrations may expose their own children.

### Scalability considerations  

* **Horizontal scaling** – Because each integration runs as an independent process (e.g., a server for Browser Access or a daemon for the Constraint Monitor), they can be containerized and scaled horizontally behind a load balancer.  
* **Configuration management** – Scaling many instances requires a centralized configuration store for hook definitions and external credentials; otherwise, divergent configs could appear.  
* **Resource isolation** – Lazy LLM initialization (`ensureLLMInitialized()`) helps keep memory footprints low when many integrations are deployed simultaneously.  

### Maintainability assessment  

The modular folder layout and rich, integration‑specific documentation make the **Integrations** sub‑component highly maintainable from a human‑readability standpoint.  However, the lack of visible unit tests or code‑level contracts in the observations means that automated verification may be limited.  Keeping the markdown guides synchronized with any code changes is critical; otherwise, the “documentation‑first” advantage erodes.  Overall, the design promotes easy onboarding and isolated evolution, provided that the hook infrastructure remains stable and documentation discipline is enforced.
