# LLMModeResolver

**Type:** SubComponent

The LLMModeResolver class (lib/llm/llm-mode-resolver.ts) uses a context-based approach to determine the LLM mode, considering factors such as environment variables and configuration settings.

## What It Is  

**LLMModeResolver** is a concrete sub‑component that lives in the file **`lib/llm/llm-mode-resolver.ts`**.  Its sole responsibility is to determine which *LLM mode* the system should operate in at any point in time.  The class imports the **`LLMMode`** interface from **`lib/llm/llm-mode.ts`**, guaranteeing that the mode objects it produces conform to a shared contract used throughout the LLM abstraction layer.  The resolver exposes three public methods that drive its behaviour:

* **`resolveMode()`** – evaluates the current execution context (environment variables, runtime configuration, etc.) and returns the most appropriate `LLMMode` instance.  
* **`getMode()`** – returns the mode that is currently cached and therefore active for the calling code.  
* **`updateMode()`** – recomputes the mode when the surrounding context or configuration changes and refreshes the internal cache.

Together, these members give the rest of the LLM stack a deterministic, centrally‑managed way to query and react to mode changes without having to duplicate context‑inspection logic.

## Architecture and Design  

The design of **LLMModeResolver** follows a *context‑driven configuration* pattern.  Rather than hard‑coding a mode, the resolver looks at runtime information—environment variables, configuration files, and possibly other dynamic signals—to decide which mode should be active.  This is evident from the observations that the class “uses a context‑based approach” and “utilizes a configuration‑based approach”.  The two approaches are combined: the resolver first gathers raw context, then maps that context onto a configuration‑defined set of possible modes.

A lightweight **caching** strategy is built into the resolver.  After `resolveMode()` computes the appropriate mode, the result is stored internally so that subsequent calls to `getMode()` can return the cached value instantly.  When the underlying context changes, `updateMode()` is called to invalidate and recompute the cache.  This pattern reduces the overhead of repeatedly parsing environment variables or re‑reading configuration files.

The resolver also adheres to the **interface‑segregation principle** by depending on the `LLMMode` interface.  By importing `LLMMode` from `lib/llm/llm-mode.ts`, the resolver guarantees that any mode object it returns satisfies the same shape expected by other components (e.g., `LLMService`).  This decouples the resolver from concrete mode implementations and enables future extensions (new modes) without touching the resolver logic.

Within the broader **LLMAbstraction** hierarchy, the resolver is a child of the parent component **LLMAbstraction**.  The parent’s modular design, as described in the hierarchy context, separates concerns into distinct files and classes.  LLMModeResolver fits this philosophy by focusing exclusively on mode determination, while sibling components such as **LLMProviderManager**, **LLMCachingMechanism**, **LLMErrorHandling**, **LLMConfigurationManager**, and **LLMService** address provider contracts, generic caching, error handling, configuration management, and the public façade respectively.  The resolver therefore shares the same configuration‑centric mindset as **LLMConfigurationManager**, but it adds the extra step of translating that configuration into a concrete runtime mode.

---

## Implementation Details  

The core implementation resides in **`lib/llm/llm-mode-resolver.ts`** and can be broken down into three logical sections:

1. **Context Gathering** – The resolver reads from the process environment (e.g., `process.env.LLM_MODE`) and possibly from a higher‑level configuration service (provided by `LLMConfigurationManager`).  These inputs form the “current context” that drives mode selection.

2. **Mode Resolution (`resolveMode()`)** – Using the gathered context, the method applies a decision matrix (often a series of `if`/`else` checks or a lookup table) to pick the appropriate `LLMMode`.  Because the file imports the `LLMMode` interface, the returned object must implement the required members (e.g., `name`, `capabilities`, etc.).  The method returns the selected mode directly to the caller or to the internal cache.

3. **Caching and Update (`getMode()`, `updateMode()`)** –  
   * `getMode()` simply returns the cached mode instance, guaranteeing O(1) access for callers that need the current mode repeatedly.  
   * `updateMode()` is invoked when a change in the environment or configuration is detected (for example, a hot‑reload of a config file).  It calls `resolveMode()` again, replaces the cached value, and optionally emits an event or triggers downstream components (such as `LLMService`) to adapt to the new mode.

Because the resolver is a pure TypeScript class, its state is encapsulated within private fields (e.g., `_cachedMode`).  The use of private caching ensures that external code cannot inadvertently corrupt the mode state, preserving consistency across the system.

## Integration Points  

**LLMModeResolver** sits at the intersection of configuration, environment, and the higher‑level LLM façade:

* **Parent – LLMAbstraction**: The parent component aggregates all LLM‑related sub‑components.  When `LLMService` (the façade) needs to route a request to a specific provider, it first queries `LLMModeResolver.getMode()` to understand which mode (e.g., “chat”, “completion”, “embeddings”) should be used.  This tight coupling ensures that mode routing is always aligned with the current configuration.

* **Sibling – LLMConfigurationManager**: Both share a configuration‑centric mindset.  `LLMConfigurationManager` supplies the raw configuration data (perhaps via a `getConfig()` method) that `LLMModeResolver` consumes when evaluating the context.  Changes propagated by the configuration manager can trigger `LLMModeResolver.updateMode()`.

* **Sibling – LLMCachingMechanism**: While `LLMModeResolver` caches the *mode* itself, `LLMCachingMechanism` provides a generic cache for request/response payloads.  The resolver’s cache is lightweight and scoped to a single value, whereas the caching mechanism handles larger data structures.  Both caches help reduce repeated work but operate at different abstraction layers.

* **Sibling – LLMProviderManager**: After the resolver decides on a mode, `LLMProviderManager` selects the concrete provider that implements that mode’s capabilities.  The resolver’s output (`LLMMode`) often includes metadata (e.g., required capabilities) that the provider manager uses to filter compatible providers.

* **Interface – LLMMode**: The resolver imports `LLMMode` from **`lib/llm/llm-mode.ts`**, ensuring that any mode object it returns can be safely consumed by any component that expects the interface, including `LLMService` and `LLMProviderManager`.

No other files are directly referenced in the observations, so the integration narrative is limited to the entities explicitly mentioned.

## Usage Guidelines  

1. **Never instantiate the resolver directly in business logic** – Prefer obtaining a singleton instance from the `LLMAbstraction` container (or the dependency injection framework used by the project).  This guarantees that the cached mode is shared across the entire application.

2. **Treat `getMode()` as read‑only** – The method returns the cached mode; mutating the returned object can break the invariant that the resolver controls.  If a mode change is required, call `updateMode()` instead.

3. **Trigger `updateMode()` only when the underlying context truly changes** – Unnecessary calls will cause the resolver to recompute the mode and replace the cache, potentially causing downstream components (e.g., `LLMService`) to re‑initialize providers.  Hook `updateMode()` to configuration‑change events emitted by `LLMConfigurationManager`.

4. **Respect the `LLMMode` interface contract** – When extending the system with new modes, implement the `LLMMode` interface defined in `lib/llm/llm-mode.ts`.  The resolver will automatically recognize the new mode if the decision logic in `resolveMode()` is updated accordingly.

5. **Do not bypass the resolver for mode checks** – Directly reading environment variables or configuration files elsewhere in the codebase defeats the centralised decision‑making and can lead to divergent behaviour.  Always go through `LLMModeResolver`.

### Architectural patterns identified  

* **Context‑driven configuration selection** – The resolver bases its decision on runtime context and configuration.  
* **Cache‑aside (single‑value caching)** – A private cache stores the computed mode for fast retrieval.  
* **Interface‑based contract** – Dependence on the `LLMMode` interface enforces a stable contract across components.  

### Design decisions and trade‑offs  

* **Centralised mode logic** reduces duplication but introduces a single point of failure; the caching mechanism mitigates performance impact.  
* **Context + configuration blending** offers flexibility (different environments can override defaults) at the cost of slightly more complex decision logic.  
* **Lightweight caching** avoids heavyweight cache infrastructure for a single value, but it means the resolver must explicitly handle invalidation via `updateMode()`.  

### System structure insights  

The LLM stack is deliberately modular: each concern (provider selection, caching, error handling, configuration, mode resolution) lives in its own file/class.  `LLMModeResolver` is the bridge between raw configuration (`LLMConfigurationManager`) and operational behaviour (`LLMService`, `LLMProviderManager`).  Its placement under the parent `LLMAbstraction` reflects a clean separation of responsibilities.

### Scalability considerations  

* **Horizontal scaling** – Because the mode is cached per process, each instance of the service will compute its own mode independently.  This works as long as environment variables and configuration are consistent across instances.  
* **Dynamic reconfiguration** – The `updateMode()` method allows the system to react to configuration changes without a full restart, supporting zero‑downtime updates.  
* **Future mode expansion** – Adding new modes only requires extending the `LLMMode` interface and updating the decision matrix in `resolveMode()`, which scales well with limited code churn.  

### Maintainability assessment  

The resolver’s responsibilities are narrowly scoped, making it easy to understand and test.  Its reliance on explicit interfaces (`LLMMode`) and simple caching logic reduces hidden coupling.  The primary maintenance burden lies in keeping the decision logic in `resolveMode()` synchronized with any new configuration options or environment variables introduced elsewhere.  Because the resolver is a single class with a clear public API (`resolveMode`, `getMode`, `updateMode`), refactoring or extending it can be done with minimal impact on sibling components.

## Hierarchy Context

### Parent
- [LLMAbstraction](./LLMAbstraction.md) -- The LLMAbstraction component's modular design is evident in its separation of concerns, with distinct files and classes dedicated to specific aspects of its functionality. For instance, the LLMService class (lib/llm/llm-service.ts) serves as a high-level facade for all LLM operations, handling tasks such as mode routing, caching, and provider fallback. This modularity enables easier maintenance, updates, and extensions of the component. Furthermore, the use of interfaces like LLMCompletionRequest and LLMCompletionResult (lib/llm/llm-service.ts) facilitates communication between different parts of the component, ensuring consistency in data exchange.

### Siblings
- [LLMProviderManager](./LLMProviderManager.md) -- LLMProviderManager utilizes the lib/llm/llm-provider.ts file to define the LLMProvider interface, which outlines the contract for all LLM providers.
- [LLMCachingMechanism](./LLMCachingMechanism.md) -- The LLMCachingMechanism class (lib/llm/llm-caching-mechanism.ts) utilizes a cache-based approach to store frequently accessed data, reducing the number of requests to LLM providers.
- [LLMErrorHandling](./LLMErrorHandling.md) -- The LLMErrorHandling class (lib/llm/llm-error-handling.ts) utilizes a try-catch approach to catch and handle errors that occur during LLM provider interactions.
- [LLMConfigurationManager](./LLMConfigurationManager.md) -- The LLMConfigurationManager class (lib/llm/llm-configuration-manager.ts) utilizes a configuration-based approach to manage the behavior of the LLMAbstraction component.
- [LLMService](./LLMService.md) -- The LLMService class (lib/llm/llm-service.ts) utilizes a facade-based approach to provide a high-level interface for LLM operations.
