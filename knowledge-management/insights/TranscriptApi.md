# TranscriptApi

**Type:** SubComponent

The TranscriptApi defined in the lib/agent-api/transcript-api.js file provides a set of API endpoints for managing and retrieving transcripts, including the getTranscript() function that handles HTTP requests to fetch transcript data.

## What It Is  

`TranscriptApi` is the concrete implementation that exposes a programmatic interface for accessing and manipulating transcript data inside the **LiveLoggingSystem**.  The source lives in **`lib/agent-api/transcript-api.js`**, where a collection of HTTP‑style endpoints is defined.  The most visible entry point is the `getTranscript()` function, which receives an incoming request, extracts the required identifiers, invokes the underlying transcript store, and returns the transcript payload to the caller.  By design, `TranscriptApi` is a **sub‑component** of the larger LiveLoggingSystem and does not embed logging or LSL‑conversion logic – those responsibilities belong to sibling modules (`LoggingModule` and `LslConverter`).  

In practice, `TranscriptApi` acts as the façade through which external clients (e.g., UI widgets, other services, or test harnesses) retrieve raw or processed transcripts.  Its contract is limited to CRUD‑style operations on transcript resources, keeping the surface area small and well‑defined.  Because the implementation is isolated in a single file, developers can locate the full set of routes and helper utilities without navigating a sprawling codebase.

## Architecture and Design  

The observations reveal a **modular architecture** built around clear separation of concerns.  The parent component, **LiveLoggingSystem**, orchestrates three independent modules:

* **LoggingModule** – located in `integrations/mcp-server-semantic-analysis/src/logging.ts`
* **TranscriptApi** – located in `lib/agent-api/transcript-api.js`
* **LslConverter** – located in `lib/agent-api/transcripts/lsl-converter.js`

Each module lives in its own directory hierarchy and provides a distinct functional slice (logging, transcript management, and LSL conversion, respectively).  This layout follows a **layered design** where the LiveLoggingSystem acts as the composition root, wiring the modules together while allowing each to evolve independently.  

`TranscriptApi` itself follows an **API‑gateway pattern** at the sub‑component level: it defines HTTP‑oriented entry points (`getTranscript()` and the implied create/update/delete handlers) that delegate to lower‑level services or data stores.  The API layer is deliberately decoupled from the logging and conversion layers, meaning that changes to request handling or response shaping do not ripple into the logging implementation or the LSL conversion algorithm.  The only explicit interaction visible in the observations is that `TranscriptApi` is *contained* by LiveLoggingSystem, implying that the parent may inject shared services (e.g., authentication, configuration) into the API at runtime.

---

## Implementation Details  

The core of the implementation resides in **`lib/agent-api/transcript-api.js`**.  Within this file a set of route handlers is exported; the most concrete example is the `getTranscript()` function.  `getTranscript()` performs the following steps:

1. **Request parsing** – extracts query parameters or path variables that identify the desired transcript (e.g., session ID, user ID).  
2. **Service delegation** – calls an internal transcript service or repository (the exact class name is not enumerated in the observations, but its existence is implied by the need to “fetch transcript data”).  
3. **Response construction** – formats the retrieved transcript into a JSON payload and writes it to the HTTP response object, handling error cases such as missing transcripts or malformed identifiers.  

Because the API is separated from logging, any diagnostic information required during request handling must be supplied by the parent LiveLoggingSystem or by a shared logger that is injected at runtime.  Likewise, the API does **not** perform LSL conversion; that responsibility lives in `lib/agent-api/transcripts/lsl-converter.js`.  If a client needs an LSL‑formatted transcript, it would first call `getTranscript()` and then pass the result to the LSL converter through a separate integration point.

The file organization—one top‑level JavaScript file for the API and distinct TypeScript/JavaScript files for logging and conversion—facilitates focused unit testing.  Each module can be mocked independently, allowing the `TranscriptApi` tests to stub out logging calls and LSL conversion without pulling in the full implementation of those siblings.

---

## Integration Points  

`TranscriptApi` integrates with the rest of the system primarily through the **LiveLoggingSystem** container.  The parent component is responsible for:

* **Dependency injection** – providing any shared services such as authentication middleware, configuration objects, or a logger instance that `TranscriptApi` may use indirectly.  
* **Routing composition** – mounting the API’s endpoints onto the LiveLoggingSystem’s HTTP server (e.g., Express or a similar framework).  

Sibling modules interact with `TranscriptApi` only at the data‑exchange level.  For example, a downstream workflow might retrieve a transcript via `getTranscript()`, then hand the raw transcript to the **LslConverter** (`lib/agent-api/transcripts/lsl-converter.js`) to produce an LSL document.  Conversely, the **LoggingModule** (`integrations/mcp-server-semantic-analysis/src/logging.ts`) may log request metadata or errors that originate in the API, but it does not embed any logging code inside `transcript-api.js`.  

No direct file‑level imports between `transcript-api.js` and the sibling modules are mentioned, reinforcing the intentional isolation.  The only visible contract is the HTTP interface exposed by `TranscriptApi`, which other components can consume using standard HTTP clients or internal request wrappers.

---

## Usage Guidelines  

When extending or consuming `TranscriptApi`, developers should respect its **boundary‑only** contract.  All interactions must occur through the defined HTTP endpoints; internal functions such as `getTranscript()` should be treated as private implementation details unless explicitly exported.  Because logging is handled elsewhere, any custom diagnostic output should be routed through the logger supplied by LiveLoggingSystem rather than invoking console methods directly.  

If a new transcript‑related feature is required (e.g., bulk export, versioning), it should be added as an additional route in `lib/agent-api/transcript-api.js` while keeping the core logic separate from logging and conversion.  Unit tests for the new route should mock the underlying transcript store and any external services, ensuring that the API layer remains isolated.  

When integrating with the **LslConverter**, callers must fetch the transcript via the API first and then invoke the converter explicitly; the API does not perform automatic conversion.  Likewise, any error handling strategy (e.g., returning standardized error codes) should be consistent with the other sub‑components under LiveLoggingSystem to preserve a uniform client experience.

### Summary of Requested Items  

1. **Architectural patterns identified** – modular design, separation of concerns, layered architecture, sub‑component API‑gateway style.  
2. **Design decisions and trade‑offs** – isolating transcript handling from logging and LSL conversion improves maintainability and independent deployment but requires a parent orchestrator to manage cross‑cutting concerns; the trade‑off is a slightly more complex wiring at the LiveLoggingSystem level.  
3. **System structure insights** – LiveLoggingSystem composes three sibling modules (LoggingModule, TranscriptApi, LslConverter); each lives in its own directory, exposing a clean vertical slice of functionality.  
4. **Scalability considerations** – because each module is independent, they can be horizontally scaled or replaced without affecting the others; the API layer can be load‑balanced separately from logging or conversion services.  
5. **Maintainability assessment** – high maintainability due to clear file boundaries, focused responsibilities, and the ability to test modules in isolation; the explicit separation reduces the risk of regression when updating one slice of the system.

## Hierarchy Context

### Parent
- [LiveLoggingSystem](./LiveLoggingSystem.md) -- [LLM] The LiveLoggingSystem component utilizes a modular design, with separate modules for logging, transcript processing, and LSL conversion. This is evident in the code organization, where the logging module is implemented in integrations/mcp-server-semantic-analysis/src/logging.ts, the transcript API is defined in lib/agent-api/transcript-api.js, and the LSL converter is located in lib/agent-api/transcripts/lsl-converter.js. This modularity allows for easier maintenance and updates to individual components without affecting the entire system. For example, the logging module provides a unified logging interface, which can be easily extended or modified without impacting the transcript processing or LSL conversion functionality.

### Siblings
- [LoggingModule](./LoggingModule.md) -- LoggingModule uses a modular design, allowing for easier maintenance and updates without affecting the entire system.
- [LslConverter](./LslConverter.md) -- LslConverter uses a specific conversion algorithm to transform transcripts into LSL format.
