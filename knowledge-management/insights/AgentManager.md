# AgentManager

**Type:** SubComponent

AgentManager employs a modular approach, allowing for easier maintenance and updates as each agent can be modified or replaced without affecting the entire system.

## What It Is  

**AgentManager** is the central coordinating sub‑component that lives inside the **ConstraintSystem**. It is the hub through which the system’s various agents—most notably the **ContentValidationAgent** located at `integrations/mcp-server-semantic-analysis/src/agents/content-validation-agent.ts`—are registered, invoked, and monitored. AgentManager also mediates interactions with auxiliary services such as **ContentValidator**, **HookManager**, **Logger**, **ViolationCapture**, and **GraphDatabase**. In practice, AgentManager is the single point of truth for agent lifecycle management, validation orchestration, and logging, ensuring that each agent can be updated or swapped without destabilising the broader constraint‑checking pipeline.

## Architecture and Design  

The observations describe a **modular architecture** where each functional piece (agents, hooks, logging, graph persistence) resides in its own file and implements a clearly bounded responsibility. AgentManager embodies the *facade* role for this modular collection: it presents a simple, unified API to the rest of the ConstraintSystem while delegating the heavy lifting to the individual agents.  

- **Modular composition**: The ContentValidationAgent lives in its own source file (`.../content-validation-agent.ts`). Similar modularity is applied to HookManager, Logger, GraphDatabase, etc. This separation keeps the codebase readable and encourages isolated development.  
- **Central orchestration**: AgentManager works together with **HookManager** to load hook configurations and dispatch events. The pattern resembles a *mediator* where AgentManager receives external triggers (e.g., a request to validate content) and coordinates the appropriate agents and hooks to handle the request.  
- **Logging façade**: By depending on **Logger** and its `centralLog` wrapper, AgentManager ensures that every agent action is consistently recorded without each agent needing to manage its own logging implementation.  

No evidence of micro‑service boundaries, event‑sourcing, or other high‑level patterns is present; the design stays within a single process, leveraging modular files and clear dependency direction.

## Implementation Details  

AgentManager’s implementation revolves around three concrete responsibilities that emerge from the observations:

1. **Agent Registration & Retrieval**  
   - The manager imports the **ContentValidationAgent** from `integrations/mcp-server-semantic-analysis/src/agents/content-validation-agent.ts`.  
   - It likely maintains an internal registry (e.g., a map keyed by agent name) that allows other components—such as **ContentValidator**—to request a specific agent instance for a validation task.

2. **Validation Coordination**  
   - When a validation request arrives, AgentManager forwards the payload to **ContentValidator**, which in turn invokes the ContentValidationAgent to parse entities and verify references.  
   - The manager also ensures that any validation‑related side‑effects (e.g., capturing violations via **ViolationCapture**) are triggered in the correct order.

3. **Hook & Logging Integration**  
   - AgentManager leverages **HookManager** to load hook configurations and dispatch hook events before or after an agent runs. This makes it possible to extend behavior (e.g., custom pre‑validation checks) without touching the core agent code.  
   - All significant actions—agent start, success, failure—are wrapped with calls to **Logger.centralLog**, providing a uniform logging surface across the entire subsystem.

Because the source observations note “0 code symbols found,” the exact class or function signatures are not disclosed, but the naming conventions (`ContentValidationAgent`, `centralLog`) imply straightforward TypeScript/JavaScript modules that export a class or function used by AgentManager.

## Integration Points  

AgentManager sits at the intersection of several sibling components within the **ConstraintSystem**:

- **ContentValidator**: Calls into AgentManager to obtain the ContentValidationAgent for parsing and reference checks.  
- **HookManager**: Supplies hook configuration files and receives event dispatches from AgentManager, enabling extensible pre‑ and post‑validation logic.  
- **Logger**: Provides the `centralLog` wrapper that AgentManager uses for all its internal logging, ensuring a consistent log format across agents.  
- **ViolationCapture**: Receives violation data that AgentManager (or the agents it orchestrates) produces, persisting it via **GraphDatabase**.  
- **GraphDatabase**: Though primarily used by ViolationCapture, the database may also be accessed directly by agents for persisting validation results; AgentManager’s role is to guarantee that agents have the necessary database handle when required.

These integration points are all file‑level imports, preserving a clear dependency graph: AgentManager → ContentValidationAgent, ContentValidator, HookManager, Logger, ViolationCapture → GraphDatabase.

## Usage Guidelines  

1. **Register agents through AgentManager only** – Adding a new agent should involve placing its implementation in a dedicated file (mirroring the pattern of `content-validation-agent.ts`) and updating AgentManager’s registry. Direct imports of agents elsewhere bypass the central coordination logic and can lead to inconsistent state.  

2. **Leverage HookManager for extensibility** – If custom behaviour is needed around validation (e.g., additional sanity checks), define a hook and let AgentManager dispatch it via HookManager rather than modifying the core agent code. This preserves the modular contract.  

3. **Always log via Logger.centralLog** – Any new functionality added to AgentManager or its agents must use the provided `centralLog` wrapper. This guarantees that logs are captured uniformly and can be filtered or routed centrally.  

4. **Treat ViolationCapture as the sole persistence entry point** – Agents should report validation failures to ViolationCapture, which then uses GraphDatabase for storage. Direct database writes from agents break the separation of concerns and make future schema changes harder.  

5. **Respect the modular file boundaries** – Keep each agent, hook, or utility in its own file as the architecture prescribes. This aids onboarding, code reviews, and automated tooling that expects a one‑to‑one mapping between responsibilities and source files.

### Summary of Architectural Insights  

| Aspect | Observation‑Based Insight |
|--------|---------------------------|
| **Architectural patterns identified** | Modular composition, Facade (AgentManager as central API), Mediator‑style orchestration (AgentManager ↔ HookManager ↔ Agents) |
| **Design decisions and trade‑offs** | – One‑file‑per‑agent promotes readability and isolated updates but may increase the number of files to manage.  
– Centralised logging simplifies diagnostics at the cost of a single point of failure if Logger is mis‑configured.  
– Hook‑based extensibility adds flexibility without touching core agents, though it introduces an extra indirection layer that developers must understand. |
| **System structure insights** | AgentManager lives under **ConstraintSystem** and coordinates sibling components (ContentValidator, HookManager, Logger, ViolationCapture, GraphDatabase). Each sibling follows the same modular principle, reinforcing a consistent architectural language across the subsystem. |
| **Scalability considerations** | Because agents are loaded and invoked through a central manager, adding more agents scales linearly in terms of registration overhead. The modular design allows parallel development of agents, but the single‑process nature may become a bottleneck if validation workloads grow dramatically; at that point, agents could be extracted to separate processes or services. |
| **Maintainability assessment** | High maintainability: clear separation of concerns, isolated files per responsibility, and a unified logging/hook infrastructure. The trade‑off is the need to keep the central registry in sync with newly added agents, but this is a straightforward, low‑risk task given the existing pattern. |

These insights are drawn directly from the provided observations and reflect the current state of the **AgentManager** sub‑component within the **ConstraintSystem**.

## Hierarchy Context

### Parent
- [ConstraintSystem](./ConstraintSystem.md) -- The ConstraintSystem employs a modular architecture, with each agent having its own file and responsibility. For instance, the ContentValidationAgent (integrations/mcp-server-semantic-analysis/src/agents/content-validation-agent.ts) is responsible for parsing entities and verifying references in the codebase. This modular approach allows for easier maintenance and updates, as each agent can be modified or replaced without affecting the entire system. Furthermore, the use of a separate file for each agent promotes code organization and readability, making it easier for new developers to understand the system's architecture.

### Siblings
- [ContentValidator](./ContentValidator.md) -- ContentValidator utilizes the ContentValidationAgent in integrations/mcp-server-semantic-analysis/src/agents/content-validation-agent.ts to parse entities and verify references.
- [HookManager](./HookManager.md) -- HookManager utilizes a modular approach, allowing for easier maintenance and updates as each hook can be modified or replaced without affecting the entire system.
- [ViolationCapture](./ViolationCapture.md) -- ViolationCapture utilizes the GraphDatabase to handle graph database persistence and querying, with automatic JSON export sync.
- [Logger](./Logger.md) -- Logger utilizes the centralLog function as a simple logger wrapper to provide a logging mechanism for the system.
- [GraphDatabase](./GraphDatabase.md) -- GraphDatabase utilizes the integrations/mcp-server-semantic-analysis/src/agents/content-validation-agent.ts to handle graph database persistence and querying.
