# TmuxIntegration

**Type:** Detail

The integrations/copi/docs/STATUS-LINE-QUICK-REFERENCE.md file provides a quick reference guide for the Copi status line integration, highlighting the role of Tmux in displaying Copi status information.

## What It Is  

**TmuxIntegration** is the portion of the *UKBTraceReporting* sub‑system that connects the *Copi* GitHub Copilot CLI wrapper to a Tmux status‑line display. The integration lives under the `integrations/copi/` directory – the top‑level README (`integrations/copi/README.md`) declares that Copi “provides logging and Tmux integration,” while the companion documentation in `integrations/copi/scripts/README.md` and `integrations/copi/docs/STATUS‑LINE‑QUICK‑REFERENCE.md` describe the concrete status‑line format that is rendered inside a Tmux session. In the broader component hierarchy, **TmuxIntegration** is owned by the parent component **UKBTraceReporting**, which relies on it for visual trace‑reporting feedback, and it sits alongside the sibling **LoggingHandler** that supplies the underlying logging capabilities referenced in the same README.

---

## Architecture and Design  

The architecture exposed by the observations is a **wrapper‑driven integration**: the *Copi* CLI is wrapped by a thin scripting layer that augments its output with Tmux‑specific commands. The design does **not** introduce a formal architectural pattern such as micro‑services or event‑driven messaging; instead, it follows a **composition** approach where the *Copi* tool (responsible for generating trace data and logs) is composed with a Tmux status‑line component that consumes that data for real‑time display.  

Interaction is straightforward: the *Copi* wrapper writes status information to a location (typically a temporary file or environment variable) that the Tmux script reads and injects into the status line. The `integrations/copi/scripts/README.md` file details the script that performs this injection, while the `STATUS‑LINE‑QUICK‑REFERENCE.md` file enumerates the fields that appear on the Tmux bar (e.g., current trace ID, success/failure flags). This separation keeps the **logging** concern (handled by the sibling **LoggingHandler**) distinct from the **visualisation** concern (handled by **TmuxIntegration**), allowing each to evolve independently.

Because the only artefacts are documentation files, the design leans heavily on **convention‑over‑configuration**: developers are expected to follow the documented status‑line format and script naming conventions rather than customizing code. This reduces architectural complexity but also means the integration’s behaviour is dictated by the scripts referenced in the README files.

## Implementation Details  

Although no concrete code symbols were discovered, the documentation points to three concrete artefacts that together implement the integration:

1. **`integrations/copi/README.md`** – establishes the purpose of the wrapper, stating that Copi “provides logging functionality” and that it “integrates with Tmux.” It is the authoritative source that ties the wrapper to the parent **UKBTraceReporting** component.

2. **`integrations/copi/scripts/README.md`** – supplies the actual Tmux status‑line script (the exact script name is not listed, but the README describes its role). The script is responsible for invoking Tmux commands such as `tmux set-option -g status-left` or `tmux set-option -g status-right` to embed Copi‑generated values into the bar.

3. **`integrations/copi/docs/STATUS‑LINE‑QUICK‑REFERENCE.md`** – enumerates the fields that the status line shows (e.g., trace identifier, success indicator, timestamp). This file acts as a contract: any change to the status‑line format must be reflected here, ensuring that the script and any downstream consumers stay in sync.

The implementation therefore consists of a **shell‑script‑based pipeline**: Copi emits status data → the script reads that data → the script issues Tmux commands to update the status line. Because the pipeline is driven by shell scripts and environment variables, the integration remains lightweight and portable across any environment where Tmux is available.

## Integration Points  

**TmuxIntegration** connects to three primary parts of the system:

* **Parent – UKBTraceReporting** – The parent component invokes the Copi wrapper as part of its trace‑reporting workflow. The wrapper’s logging output is consumed by the sibling **LoggingHandler**, while the visual feedback is handed off to **TmuxIntegration** via the status‑line script. This relationship is documented in `integrations/copi/README.md`, which states that UKBTraceReporting “uses integrations/copi/README.md to handle logging and tmux integration for trace reporting.”

* **Sibling – LoggingHandler** – The same README highlights that Copi provides logging functionality, implying that **LoggingHandler** processes those logs. The separation ensures that the status‑line display does not interfere with log persistence or analysis.

* **External – Tmux runtime** – The integration depends on a running Tmux session. The script described in `integrations/copi/scripts/README.md` calls Tmux’s command‑line interface (`tmux …`) to modify the status bar. Consequently, any environment that wishes to use **TmuxIntegration** must have Tmux installed and a session active.

No explicit library or API dependencies beyond standard POSIX shell utilities and Tmux are mentioned, keeping the integration’s footprint minimal.

## Usage Guidelines  

1. **Maintain the documented contract** – When extending Copi’s status output, always update `STATUS‑LINE‑QUICK‑REFERENCE.md` first. The quick‑reference file is the single source of truth for what the status line expects; failing to keep it in sync will result in mismatched or missing information on the Tmux bar.

2. **Run within an active Tmux session** – The status‑line script will silently fail if no Tmux server is reachable. Developers should verify that `tmux ls` returns a running session before invoking the wrapper.

3. **Do not modify the wrapper script without updating the README** – Because the integration is documented primarily through the three README files, any change to the script name, location, or command‑line flags must be reflected in `integrations/copi/scripts/README.md`. This ensures that new team members can discover the integration flow without digging into the script itself.

4. **Separate concerns** – Keep logging logic inside the **LoggingHandler** component and visualisation logic inside the **TmuxIntegration** scripts. This separation mirrors the design decision highlighted in the README and simplifies future refactoring (e.g., swapping Tmux for another terminal multiplexer).

5. **Test in isolation** – Since the integration is shell‑script based, unit‑style testing is limited. Instead, developers should create a small test harness that runs the script against a mock Copi output and verifies the resulting Tmux status‑line changes using `tmux show-options -g status-left/right`.

### Summary of Requested Items  

| Item | Insight |
|------|---------|
| **Architectural patterns identified** | Wrapper‑driven composition of a CLI tool with a Tmux status‑line script; clear separation of logging (LoggingHandler) and visual feedback (TmuxIntegration). |
| **Design decisions and trade‑offs** | Chose lightweight shell scripting and convention‑based configuration for ease of deployment; trade‑off is limited type safety and reliance on external documentation rather than compiled interfaces. |
| **System structure insights** | **TmuxIntegration** lives under `integrations/copi/`, is owned by **UKBTraceReporting**, and works alongside **LoggingHandler**. All integration logic is described in markdown files rather than code symbols. |
| **Scalability considerations** | Scalability is bounded by Tmux itself – the status line can display only a modest amount of data, and the script runs synchronously with each Copi invocation. For large‑scale trace volumes, the visual component remains a lightweight monitor, not a data sink. |
| **Maintainability assessment** | High maintainability for small teams because the integration is simple and well‑documented. However, the lack of concrete code symbols means that any refactor must be carefully reflected in the README files to avoid drift. Consistent documentation updates are essential for long‑term health. |

## Hierarchy Context

### Parent
- [UKBTraceReporting](./UKBTraceReporting.md) -- UKBTraceReporting uses integrations/copi/README.md to handle logging and tmux integration for trace reporting

### Siblings
- [LoggingHandler](./LoggingHandler.md) -- The integrations/copi/README.md file mentions that Copi provides logging functionality, indicating the presence of a logging handler in the UKBTraceReporting sub-component.
