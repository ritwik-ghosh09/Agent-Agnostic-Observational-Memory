# DynamicImportMechanism

**Type:** Detail

The use of dynamic imports in the GraphDatabaseModule enables the component to be more modular and flexible, making it easier to manage dependencies and update the module without affecting other parts of the system.

## What It Is  

The **DynamicImportMechanism** is the runtime‑time loading strategy employed by the *graph‑database* layer of the code base. It lives in the file **`storage/graph-database-adapter.ts`** – the concrete adapter that the **`GraphDatabaseModule`** uses to talk to the external VK‑B API. Rather than importing the **`VkbApiClient`** module statically at the top of the file, the adapter calls the native ECMAScript **`import()`** function at the point where the client is first required. This on‑demand loading gives the adapter the ability to defer the cost of pulling in the client code until it is actually needed, and it also decouples the adapter from a hard compile‑time dependency on the client implementation.

In the broader picture, the **`GraphDatabaseModule`** declares that it “contains DynamicImportMechanism”, meaning that the module’s public contract is built around this lazy‑load capability. The mechanism is therefore a first‑class architectural element that the rest of the system can rely on when interacting with the graph database storage layer.

## Architecture and Design  

The observations point to a **lazy‑loading** approach, implemented through the native **dynamic `import()`** API. This is not a full‑blown dependency‑injection container, but it achieves a similar goal: the **`GraphDatabaseAdapter`** can request the **`VkbApiClient`** only when it needs to execute a VK‑B call, keeping the rest of the graph‑database stack lightweight.  

From an architectural standpoint the design follows a **modular decomposition**:

* **Parent** – `GraphDatabaseModule` acts as the container that orchestrates storage‑related services. Its definition references the dynamic import capability, signalling to callers that the module can resolve its own dependencies at runtime.  
* **Child** – `VkbApiClient` is the concrete implementation that provides the VK‑B API surface. Because it is loaded dynamically, the adapter does not need to know the exact version or even the existence of the client at build time.  
* **Sibling** – any other adapters that `GraphDatabaseModule` might expose (e.g., a relational‑database adapter) would share the same module‑level contract but would not necessarily use the same import strategy. The observations do not name such siblings, so the focus remains on the dynamic import path.

The interaction pattern is straightforward: when the adapter’s method that requires VK‑B communication is invoked, it checks whether the client has already been imported; if not, it triggers **`import('path/to/VkbApiClient')`**, awaits the promise, and then proceeds. This keeps the **dependency graph** shallow and permits independent version upgrades of the client without recompiling the adapter.

---

## Implementation Details  

Although the source code itself is not displayed, the observations give a clear picture of the implementation flow:

1. **Location** – The logic resides in **`storage/graph-database-adapter.ts`**. This file defines the `GraphDatabaseAdapter` class (or a similar construct) that implements the storage‑layer contract required by `GraphDatabaseModule`.  
2. **Dynamic Import Call** – Inside a method that needs to talk to VK‑B (for example, `fetchGraphData()` or `persistNode()`), the adapter executes something akin to:  

   ```ts
   const { VkbApiClient } = await import('../path/to/vkb-api-client');
   const client = new VkbApiClient(/* config */);
   // use client …
   ```  

   The `import()` call returns a promise that resolves to the module’s exports, allowing the adapter to instantiate the client only when necessary.  
3. **Caching** – A typical pattern is to store the imported module or the instantiated client in a private field so that subsequent calls reuse the same instance, avoiding repeated network fetches of the module code. The observations do not explicitly mention caching, but it is a natural extension of the lazy‑load approach.  
4. **Error Handling** – Because the import is asynchronous and can fail (e.g., missing file, version mismatch), the adapter must handle rejection of the promise, likely translating it into a domain‑specific error that bubbles up through `GraphDatabaseModule`. Again, the observations do not detail this, but the presence of a dynamic import implies such defensive coding.  

Overall, the mechanism is a thin wrapper around the standard ES module loader, leveraged to keep the graph‑database stack decoupled from the VK‑B client implementation.

## Integration Points  

The **DynamicImportMechanism** sits at the intersection of three major parts of the system:

* **`GraphDatabaseModule`** – The module’s public API expects an adapter that can provide storage services. By delegating the creation of the `VkbApiClient` to a dynamic import, the module can be instantiated without the client being present on the classpath, simplifying deployment pipelines and allowing the client to be swapped out or upgraded independently.  
* **`GraphDatabaseAdapter`** – This adapter is the concrete consumer of the dynamic import. It implements the storage interface defined by the module and uses the imported client to fulfill VK‑B‑specific operations.  
* **`VkbApiClient`** – The external library that implements the VK‑B protocol. Because it is loaded on demand, any changes to its API surface (e.g., adding new methods) only require updates to the adapter’s import call, not to the module’s wiring.  

No other explicit dependencies are mentioned, so the integration surface is limited to these three entities. The dynamic import thus acts as a *runtime contract* between the adapter and the client, while the module remains agnostic of the client’s concrete version.

---

## Usage Guidelines  

1. **Invoke the Adapter’s Methods, Not the Import Directly** – Consumers of `GraphDatabaseModule` should treat the dynamic import as an internal detail of the adapter. Call the public storage methods; the adapter will handle loading `VkbApiClient` when required.  
2. **Avoid Re‑Importing** – If you need to call multiple VK‑B‑related operations in quick succession, rely on the adapter’s internal caching (if present) rather than manually re‑importing the client. Re‑importing defeats the performance benefit of lazy loading.  
3. **Handle Asynchronous Errors** – Since the import returns a promise, any call that triggers the import must be awaited or properly chained with `.catch`. Propagate meaningful error messages up to the module level so that callers can react (e.g., fallback to a mock client).  
4. **Version Compatibility** – When upgrading `VkbApiClient`, ensure that the exported symbols (`VkbApiClient` class, its constructor signature, etc.) remain compatible with the adapter’s expectations. Because the import is dynamic, a mismatch will surface at runtime rather than compile time.  
5. **Testing** – In unit tests, you can mock the dynamic import by using a test‑time stub that resolves to a fake client. This keeps tests fast and deterministic while still exercising the lazy‑load path.

### Architectural Patterns Identified  

* **Lazy Loading / On‑Demand Loading** – Implemented via native `import()` to defer module loading.  
* **Modular Decomposition** – `GraphDatabaseModule` encapsulates storage adapters, each able to manage its own dependencies.  

### Design Decisions and Trade‑offs  

* **Flexibility vs. Compile‑time Safety** – Dynamic import removes a hard compile‑time dependency, allowing the client to be swapped or upgraded without rebuilding the adapter. The trade‑off is loss of static type‑checking for the imported symbols, shifting error detection to runtime.  
* **Performance Considerations** – Initial call incurs a network or filesystem fetch of the client module, which can add latency. Subsequent calls benefit from caching, so the design favors workloads where VK‑B interactions are infrequent or batched.  

### System Structure Insights  

* The **graph‑database** layer is organized around a central `GraphDatabaseModule` that delegates concrete storage operations to adapters.  
* The **DynamicImportMechanism** is localized to the adapter that talks to an external API (`VkbApiClient`), indicating a boundary where external integration is isolated.  

### Scalability Considerations  

* Because the client is loaded only when needed, the system can scale to many instances of `GraphDatabaseModule` without each instance paying the import cost up front.  
* If the number of concurrent VK‑B calls grows, the import cost becomes negligible after the first load, and the design scales horizontally as each instance reuses the already‑loaded client module.  

### Maintainability Assessment  

* **Positive** – The separation of concerns (module → adapter → client) and the use of a dynamic import keep the codebase modular. Upgrading or swapping `VkbApiClient` does not ripple through the rest of the graph‑database code.  
* **Potential Risk** – Runtime import errors are harder to detect early, so developers must maintain good test coverage and clear documentation of the expected client API. Proper error handling in the adapter mitigates this risk.  

Overall, the **DynamicImportMechanism** provides a pragmatic balance between flexibility and performance for the graph‑database component, while keeping the architectural footprint simple and maintainable.

## Hierarchy Context

### Parent
- [GraphDatabaseModule](./GraphDatabaseModule.md) -- GraphDatabaseModule uses a dynamic import mechanism in GraphDatabaseAdapter (storage/graph-database-adapter.ts) to load the VkbApiClient module, allowing for flexibility in the component's dependencies.
