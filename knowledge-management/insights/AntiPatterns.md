# AntiPatterns

**Type:** SubComponent

AntiPatterns may include a refactoring strategy module (e.g., RefactoringStrategies.ts) that provides methods for improving code.

## What It Is  

**AntiPatterns** is a sub‑component of the **CodingPatterns** domain that encapsulates the definition, storage, and evolution of known anti‑pattern instances within the code base. The core of the implementation lives in the same storage layer used by its parent component – the **GraphDatabaseAdapter** located at `storage/graph-database-adapter.ts`.  AntiPatterns relies on this adapter to persist its domain objects (most likely defined in `AntiPattern.ts`) into a **Graphology** graph that is backed by **LevelDB**.  A complementary module, `RefactoringStrategies.ts`, is expected to expose a catalogue of remediation techniques that can be applied to the stored anti‑patterns.  

Because the component sits under **CodingPatterns**, it inherits the project‑wide conventions for data handling, coding‑style enforcement, and export‑to‑JSON behaviour that the parent component has already established.  Its sibling, **ProjectTemplates**, follows the same persistence strategy, which reinforces a consistent architectural language across the code‑base.

---

## Architecture and Design  

The design of **AntiPatterns** follows a **modular, layered architecture**.  At the lowest layer sits the **GraphDatabaseAdapter** (`storage/graph-database-adapter.ts`), which abstracts the underlying **Graphology + LevelDB** persistence mechanism.  This adapter implements the **Adapter pattern**, translating the domain‑level operations of AntiPatterns into concrete graph‑database calls without leaking storage details into the business logic.

Above the adapter, the **domain layer** (e.g., `AntiPattern.ts`) models the anti‑pattern entities.  This layer is a classic example of a **Domain Model** that isolates the shape of data from how it is stored.  The optional `RefactoringStrategies.ts` module represents a **Strategy**‑oriented design: each refactoring technique can be encapsulated as a strategy object that knows how to transform a given anti‑pattern instance.

Interaction between components is **event‑free and synchronous**: the parent component **CodingPatterns** injects or imports the same `GraphDatabaseAdapter`, guaranteeing that both AntiPatterns and its sibling **ProjectTemplates** share a single source of truth for graph data.  The adapter also “automatically syncs data to JSON for export,” indicating a **Facade**‑like responsibility for serialisation that keeps export concerns out of the domain model.

---

## Implementation Details  

1. **GraphDatabaseAdapter (`storage/graph-database-adapter.ts`)** – This file houses the only persistence entry point for AntiPatterns.  It wraps Graphology’s API and configures LevelDB as the backing store.  By exposing generic CRUD methods (e.g., `addNode`, `getNode`, `updateNode`, `removeNode`), it allows the anti‑pattern domain to persist graph nodes that represent individual anti‑pattern records.

2. **Anti‑Pattern Data Model (`AntiPattern.ts`)** – Although the file is not listed explicitly in the file tree, the observation suggests its existence.  It likely defines a TypeScript interface or class that captures fields such as `id`, `name`, `description`, `severity`, and perhaps links to related code artifacts.  Because the model is separate from the adapter, developers can evolve the shape of an anti‑pattern without touching persistence code.

3. **Refactoring Strategies (`RefactoringStrategies.ts`)** – This module is presumed to expose a collection of functions or classes that map an anti‑pattern to a concrete remediation step.  For example, a `ReplaceSingletonStrategy` could accept an `AntiPattern` instance and return a transformation plan.  By keeping these strategies isolated, the component adheres to the **Single Responsibility Principle**.

4. **Integration with CodingPatterns** – The parent component already uses the same adapter, which means the AntiPatterns sub‑component does not instantiate its own database connection.  Instead, it likely receives a shared adapter instance via import or dependency injection, ensuring that all graph modifications are atomically reflected across the entire CodingPatterns domain.

5. **Export to JSON** – The adapter’s “automatic sync to JSON” suggests a background job or a hook that serialises the current graph state after each mutation.  This provides a portable snapshot for downstream tooling (e.g., documentation generators or analytics pipelines) without requiring explicit export calls from the AntiPatterns code.

---

## Integration Points  

- **Parent Component – CodingPatterns**: AntiPatterns inherits the storage contract defined by the parent.  Any change to the adapter (e.g., switching LevelDB to another key‑value store) propagates automatically to AntiPatterns, preserving consistency across the whole CodingPatterns suite.

- **Sibling Component – ProjectTemplates**: Both components consume the same `GraphDatabaseAdapter`.  This shared dependency creates a de‑facto **common data layer**, allowing cross‑component queries such as “list all templates that reference a given anti‑pattern” without additional plumbing.

- **Refactoring Engine**: If the broader system includes a code‑generation or transformation engine, `RefactoringStrategies.ts` serves as the contract point.  The engine can request a strategy for a particular anti‑pattern, apply the returned transformation, and then persist the updated graph node via the adapter.

- **Export/Reporting Tools**: The JSON synchronisation performed by the adapter provides a stable integration surface for reporting dashboards, CI pipelines, or documentation generators that need a snapshot of anti‑pattern data.

- **Testing Harnesses**: Because the storage concerns are encapsulated in the adapter, unit tests for the domain model (`AntiPattern.ts`) and the refactoring strategies can replace the real adapter with an in‑memory mock, enabling fast, deterministic tests.

## Usage Guidelines  

1. **Always interact through the GraphDatabaseAdapter** – Direct manipulation of LevelDB files or Graphology internals is prohibited.  Use the adapter’s public methods to create, read, update, or delete anti‑pattern nodes.  This guarantees that the automatic JSON sync remains functional.

2. **Keep the data model immutable where possible** – When updating an anti‑pattern, construct a new `AntiPattern` instance and pass it to the adapter’s update method.  This reduces side‑effects and aligns with the functional style encouraged by the parent component.

3. **Leverage RefactoringStrategies for remediation** – Do not embed refactoring logic inside UI components or services.  Instead, call the appropriate function from `RefactoringStrategies.ts`, pass the target `AntiPattern`, and let the strategy return a transformation plan that can be executed by the code‑modification subsystem.

4. **Respect the shared adapter instance** – If you need a custom configuration (e.g., a test‑only in‑memory LevelDB), create a scoped adapter instance rather than altering the global one.  This prevents unintended cross‑test contamination and preserves the integrity of the production graph.

5. **Version control the JSON exports** – Since the adapter automatically writes JSON snapshots, treat the generated files as artefacts that can be version‑controlled for audit trails.  Do not manually edit these files; any change should flow through the domain model and adapter.

### Architectural patterns identified
- **Adapter Pattern** – `storage/graph-database-adapter.ts` abstracts Graphology + LevelDB.
- **Domain Model** – `AntiPattern.ts` defines the business entity separate from persistence.
- **Strategy Pattern** – `RefactoringStrategies.ts` encapsulates remediation algorithms.
- **Facade / Synchronisation** – Adapter automatically syncs graph data to JSON.
- **Modular Layered Architecture** – Clear separation between storage, domain, and strategy layers.

### Design decisions and trade‑offs
- **Single shared persistence adapter** simplifies consistency but creates a tight coupling between sibling components; a change to the adapter impacts all consumers.
- **Graphology + LevelDB** offers fast key‑value look‑ups and graph traversals, beneficial for relationship‑heavy anti‑pattern queries, yet introduces a learning curve for developers unfamiliar with graph databases.
- **Automatic JSON export** provides out‑of‑the‑box reporting but may add I/O overhead on every mutation; the trade‑off favours visibility over raw performance.
- **Separate RefactoringStrategies module** isolates remediation logic, improving testability, but requires disciplined versioning to keep strategies in sync with evolving anti‑pattern definitions.

### System structure insights
- AntiPatterns sits under **CodingPatterns**, sharing the same storage backbone.
- Its sibling **ProjectTemplates** mirrors the same architectural choices, indicating a deliberate pattern of “graph‑backed sub‑components” across the domain.
- The component hierarchy suggests a **horizontal modularisation** where each sub‑component (AntiPatterns, ProjectTemplates) is a plug‑in to a common data layer rather than a deep inheritance tree.

### Scalability considerations
- **Graphology + LevelDB** scales well for read‑heavy workloads and can handle large numbers of nodes/edges, making the anti‑pattern catalogue extensible as the code base grows.
- The automatic JSON sync could become a bottleneck if mutation frequency spikes; batching or asynchronous export could be introduced later without breaking the core design.
- Because the adapter abstracts the storage, swapping LevelDB for a more distributed graph store (e.g., Neo4j) would be feasible, supporting horizontal scaling if needed.

### Maintainability assessment
- **High maintainability** thanks to clear separation of concerns: storage, domain model, and remediation logic live in distinct files.
- The use of well‑known patterns (Adapter, Strategy) makes the codebase approachable for new developers.
- Shared adapter reduces duplication but mandates careful change management; comprehensive unit and integration tests around the adapter are essential to safeguard against regressions.
- Automatic JSON export reduces manual export code, lowering maintenance overhead for reporting features.

## Hierarchy Context

### Parent
- [CodingPatterns](./CodingPatterns.md) -- [LLM] The CodingPatterns component exhibits a modular design, with the GraphDatabaseAdapter (storage/graph-database-adapter.ts) playing a crucial role in data storage and management. This adapter enables Graphology+LevelDB persistence, automatically syncing data to JSON for export. The use of this adapter suggests a structured approach to data storage, allowing for efficient data retrieval and manipulation. Furthermore, the integration of this adapter with other components ensures consistency and adherence to coding standards across the project.

### Siblings
- [ProjectTemplates](./ProjectTemplates.md) -- ProjectTemplates uses the GraphDatabaseAdapter (storage/graph-database-adapter.ts) for storing and retrieving template data.
