# ConstraintMonitoringService

**Type:** SubComponent

The ConstraintMonitoringService provides a dashboard server, as defined in the integrations/mcp-constraint-monitor/dashboard/README.md file, to visualize the constraints and their dependencies.

## What It Is  

The **ConstraintMonitoringService** is a sub‑component that lives inside the *DockerizedServices* suite. Its primary artefacts are located under the `integrations/mcp-constraint-monitor/` directory. The service’s configuration is driven by the markdown file `integrations/mcp-constraint-monitor/docs/constraint-configuration.md`, which defines the set of constraints to be monitored and the relationships among them. In addition, the service ships a dedicated dashboard server whose instructions are documented in `integrations/mcp-constraint-monitor/dashboard/README.md`. The dashboard visualises the constraints and their dependencies for operators.  

Operationally the service runs in its own Docker container (as defined in the shared `docker‑compose.yaml` of the parent *DockerizedServices* component). It consumes a number of environment variables—`CODE_GRAPH_RAG_SSE_PORT`, `CODE_GRAPH_RAG_PORT`, `MEMGRAPH_BATCH_SIZE`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `BROWSERBASE_API_KEY`, `BROWSER_ACCESS_PORT`, and `BROWSER_ACCESS_SSE_URL`—to wire up external services such as the Code Graph RAG service, a Memgraph database, and a browser‑access layer. The service also leverages the semantic‑constraint‑detection logic described in `semantic-constraint-detection.md` to recognise higher‑level, semantic constraints in the code base.

## Architecture and Design  

The observations point to a **container‑per‑service** architectural style orchestrated by Docker Compose. Within the *DockerizedServices* parent, each service—including the ConstraintMonitoringService’s API server and its dashboard server—has its own container, enabling isolated runtime environments and independent scaling. This mirrors the approach taken by sibling components such as **ServiceOrchestrator** and **CodeGraphRAGService**, which also declare their own containers and rely on environment variables for configuration.  

The service’s design is **configuration‑driven**. The `constraint-configuration.md` file acts as the single source of truth for which constraints are active and how they depend on one another. By externalising this data, the service can be re‑configured without code changes, supporting rapid iteration on constraint policies.  

Interaction with external systems follows a **port‑based integration** model. The environment variables `CODE_GRAPH_RAG_SSE_PORT` and `CODE_GRAPH_RAG_PORT` expose the ports on which the Code Graph RAG service listens, allowing the ConstraintMonitoringService to communicate over HTTP/HTTPS without hard‑coding network details. Similarly, `MEMGRAPH_BATCH_SIZE` tunes the batch size for writes to the Memgraph graph database, indicating a bulk‑loading optimisation pattern.  

Security credentials (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `BROWSERBASE_API_KEY`) are injected via environment variables, adhering to the **12‑factor app** practice of separating config from code. The presence of `BROWSER_ACCESS_PORT` and `BROWSER_ACCESS_SSE_URL` suggests a **server‑sent events (SSE)** channel used to push real‑time updates from a browser‑access service to the monitoring component.

## Implementation Details  

Although no concrete code symbols were discovered, the file‑level artefacts reveal the key implementation pieces:

1. **Constraint Configuration** – `integrations/mcp-constraint-monitor/docs/constraint-configuration.md` provides a declarative schema (likely YAML or JSON embedded in markdown) that lists constraint identifiers, thresholds, and dependency graphs. The service parses this document at startup to build an in‑memory model of the monitoring landscape.

2. **Semantic Constraint Detection** – The `semantic-constraint-detection.md` document describes the algorithms or heuristics used to infer semantic constraints from source artefacts. The service probably loads this logic as a library or script that analyses code symbols, then maps the results onto the constraint model defined above.

3. **Dashboard Server** – `integrations/mcp-constraint-monitor/dashboard/README.md` outlines how the dashboard is packaged (likely a Node.js or static‑site server) and how it consumes the service’s internal state via a REST or SSE endpoint. The dashboard visualises the constraint graph, highlighting violations and dependency chains.

4. **Environment‑Driven Wiring** – The service reads the following variables at runtime:
   - `CODE_GRAPH_RAG_SSE_PORT` / `CODE_GRAPH_RAG_PORT`: address the Code Graph RAG service for graph queries and streaming updates.
   - `MEMGRAPH_BATCH_SIZE`: controls how many constraint events are bundled before persisting to Memgraph, balancing latency versus throughput.
   - `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` / `BROWSERBASE_API_KEY`: authenticate calls to external AI or browser‑automation services.
   - `BROWSER_ACCESS_PORT` / `BROWSER_ACCESS_SSE_URL`: configure a browser‑access micro‑service that streams UI interactions back to the monitor.

5. **Child Component – ConstraintConfigurator** – The ConstraintMonitoringService contains a **ConstraintConfigurator** sub‑component, whose responsibilities are to read the `constraint-configuration.md` file, validate its syntax, and expose an API (likely HTTP) for dynamic updates. This encapsulation isolates configuration concerns from the core monitoring loop.

---

## Integration Points  

The service sits at the intersection of several other DockerizedServices components:

* **CodeGraphRAGService** – Provides the underlying code‑graph data that the monitor queries. Communication occurs over the ports exposed via `CODE_GRAPH_RAG_SSE_PORT` and `CODE_GRAPH_RAG_PORT`. The monitor likely issues graph queries to retrieve dependency information needed for constraint evaluation.

* **Memgraph Database** – Acts as the persistent store for constraint events and graph snapshots. The batch size (`MEMGRAPH_BATCH_SIZE`) is tuned to optimise write performance, indicating a bulk‑insert pattern.

* **Anthropic & BrowserBase APIs** – External AI or browser‑automation services are accessed using the injected API keys. These services may be used for advanced semantic analysis or for driving a headless browser that validates UI‑level constraints.

* **Browser Access Service** – Configured via `BROWSER_ACCESS_PORT` and `BROWSER_ACCESS_SSE_URL`, this service streams real‑time browser interaction data back to the monitor, enabling live constraint checking against user actions.

* **Dashboard UI** – The dashboard server reads the internal constraint state (potentially via a local HTTP endpoint) and renders it for operators. It consumes the same configuration and runtime data that the API server uses, ensuring a consistent view.

All of these integrations are declaratively wired through environment variables, keeping the container images generic and reusable across environments (dev, test, prod).

## Usage Guidelines  

1. **Configuration First** – Before launching the service, edit `integrations/mcp-constraint-monitor/docs/constraint-configuration.md` to enumerate the constraints relevant to your code base. Validate the file using the ConstraintConfigurator’s validation endpoint (if exposed) to catch syntax errors early.

2. **Environment Variable Management** – Store all required secrets (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `BROWSERBASE_API_KEY`) in a secure secret manager and inject them at container start‑up. Avoid hard‑coding values in Dockerfiles or source code.

3. **Port Alignment** – Ensure that the ports defined by `CODE_GRAPH_RAG_SSE_PORT` and `CODE_GRAPH_RAG_PORT` match the actual ports exposed by the **CodeGraphRAGService** container. Mismatched ports will cause runtime connection failures.

4. **Batch Size Tuning** – Adjust `MEMGRAPH_BATCH_SIZE` based on the expected event rate. Larger batches improve throughput but increase latency for constraint violation detection. Start with the default and monitor Memgraph write latency.

5. **Dashboard Access** – Run the dashboard server as defined in `integrations/mcp-constraint-monitor/dashboard/README.md`. Access it via the host‑mapped port to visualise constraint health. Use the dashboard for troubleshooting and for confirming that constraint dependencies are correctly represented.

6. **Observability** – Leverage the SSE endpoints (`BROWSER_ACCESS_SSE_URL`) to stream live updates to monitoring tools or log aggregators. This provides immediate feedback when constraints are breached.

7. **Version Compatibility** – Because the service shares the Docker Compose orchestration with siblings, keep all service images at compatible versions. Updating the **CodeGraphRAGService** may require a corresponding update to the port variables or API contract used by the monitor.

### Architectural Patterns Identified  

1. **Container‑Per‑Service (Docker Compose) Architecture** – Isolation and independent lifecycle management.  
2. **Configuration‑Driven Design** – Centralised markdown configuration for constraints.  
3. **Port‑Based External Service Integration** – Environment‑variable driven network wiring.  
4. **12‑Factor App Config Separation** – Secrets and runtime settings supplied via environment variables.  
5. **Batch Processing for Graph Persistence** – Tunable batch size for Memgraph writes.  

### Design Decisions and Trade‑offs  

* **Isolation vs. Overhead** – Running the API server and dashboard in separate containers simplifies scaling but adds inter‑container networking overhead.  
* **Markdown‑Based Config** – Human‑readable and easy to edit, but parsing markdown at runtime can be slower than a binary config format.  
* **Environment Variable Wiring** – Provides flexibility across environments, yet requires careful secret management to avoid leakage.  
* **Batch Size Tuning** – Improves write performance at the cost of detection latency; developers must balance based on workload characteristics.  

### System Structure Insights  

The ConstraintMonitoringService sits under the *DockerizedServices* parent, sharing the same compose‑file orchestration with **ServiceOrchestrator** and **CodeGraphRAGService**. Its child, **ConstraintConfigurator**, encapsulates all configuration parsing and validation logic, keeping the monitoring core focused on evaluation and reporting. The service’s external dependencies (CodeGraphRAG, Memgraph, AI APIs, browser access) are all decoupled via ports and keys, enabling substitution or version upgrades without code changes.

### Scalability Considerations  

* **Horizontal Scaling** – Because the API server is containerised, multiple instances can be launched behind a load balancer to handle higher request volumes. The dashboard is read‑only and can be scaled similarly.  
* **Graph Store Throughput** – Scaling Memgraph horizontally may be required if constraint event rates exceed the capacity of a single instance; the `MEMGRAPH_BATCH_SIZE` can be increased to reduce write pressure.  
* **Port Conflicts** – When scaling, each replica must be assigned unique host ports or use an internal network with service discovery to avoid collisions.  

### Maintainability Assessment  

The heavy reliance on declarative markdown files and environment variables makes the service **easy to maintain** for teams familiar with Docker Compose. The clear separation between configuration (ConstraintConfigurator) and runtime logic reduces the risk of accidental side effects when updating constraints. However, the lack of explicit code symbols in the current repository view suggests that the core implementation may be hidden behind scripts or compiled binaries, which could hinder direct code‑level debugging. Proper documentation of the markdown schema and the expected shape of external APIs (CodeGraphRAG, Memgraph) is essential to keep maintenance effort low.
