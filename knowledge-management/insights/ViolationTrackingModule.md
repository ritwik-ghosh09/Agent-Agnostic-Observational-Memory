# ViolationTrackingModule

**Type:** SubComponent

The trackConstraintViolations function in ViolationTrackingModule captures and logs constraint violations, leveraging the adapter's graph data storage capabilities.

## What It Is  

The **ViolationTrackingModule** lives inside the constraint‑system code‑base and is the dedicated sub‑component responsible for persisting, querying, and summarising constraint‑violation data. All of its storage interactions are routed through the **GraphDatabaseAdapter** implementation found at `storage/graph-database-adapter.ts`. The module’s public API is centred on the `trackConstraintViolations` function, which captures a violation event, logs the occurrence via the **LoggingModule**, and stores the structured violation record through the **ViolationRepository** class.  

Because the module is a child of **ConstraintSystem**, it inherits the system‑wide graph‑persistence strategy (the same adapter is also used by sibling components such as **ValidationModule** and **GraphPersistenceModule**). A dedicated child component, **GraphDatabaseAdapterIntegration**, encapsulates the wiring between the module and the shared adapter, keeping the integration details isolated from the core tracking logic.

## Architecture and Design  

The observations reveal a **layered architecture** built around a clear separation of concerns:

1. **Adapter Layer** – The `storage/graph-database-adapter.ts` file implements a *GraphDatabaseAdapter* that abstracts the underlying graph store. Both **ViolationTrackingModule** and its siblings (e.g., **ValidationModule**, **GraphPersistenceModule**) depend on this single adapter, which enforces a consistent persistence contract across the system.  

2. **Repository Layer** – The `ViolationRepository` class acts as the data‑access façade for violation records. By exposing methods for storage and retrieval, it isolates the higher‑level tracking logic from direct adapter calls, embodying the *Repository* pattern.  

3. **Service/Business‑Logic Layer** – The `trackConstraintViolations` function lives in the module’s service surface. It orchestrates three responsibilities: (a) receiving a raw violation event, (b) delegating persistence to `ViolationRepository`, and (c) delegating logging to the **LoggingModule**.  

4. **Aggregation & Presentation Layer** – The module performs **data aggregation** to produce summarized views (e.g., counts per rule, time‑windowed trends). This aggregation is performed on top of the graph data, enabling high‑performance queries required for dashboard visualisation (see sibling **DashboardModule**).  

5. **Extensibility Hook** – “Customizable violation tracking rules” indicate a plug‑in style mechanism (often realised via a *Strategy*‑like approach) that lets developers register new constraint definitions and validation callbacks without altering the core tracking flow.

Overall, the design leans heavily on **dependency inversion**: the module depends on abstract interfaces (`GraphDatabaseAdapter`, `LoggingModule`) rather than concrete implementations, allowing the same storage engine to be shared across the parent **ConstraintSystem** and its siblings.

## Implementation Details  

- **GraphDatabaseAdapter (`storage/graph-database-adapter.ts`)** – Provides methods such as `saveNode`, `queryEdges`, and an automatic JSON‑export sync. The adapter is the single source of truth for all graph‑related I/O, and it guarantees that every violation record is persisted in a format consumable by downstream analytics.  

- **ViolationRepository** – Encapsulates CRUD‑style operations for violation entities. Typical methods (inferred from the repository role) include `createViolation(record)`, `findViolations(filter)`, and `aggregateViolations(params)`. By funnelling all graph calls through this class, the module can evolve its storage schema without impacting callers.  

- **trackConstraintViolations** – This function is the entry point for any component that detects a constraint breach. It receives a violation payload, invokes `ViolationRepository.createViolation`, and then calls the **LoggingModule** (e.g., `logger.warn` or `logger.error`) to surface the event for operational monitoring.  

- **Data Aggregation** – The module leverages the graph’s native query capabilities to compute aggregates such as “total violations per rule per day”. The results are shaped for consumption by the **DashboardModule**, which renders the visual summaries.  

- **Custom Rule Engine** – While not spelled out in code, the observation that the module “supports customizable violation tracking rules” suggests an extensible registry where new rule objects (implementing a known interface) can be added at runtime. These rule objects supply validation logic that ultimately triggers `trackConstraintViolations` when they fail.  

- **Logging Integration** – Interaction with the **LoggingModule** is straightforward: the module imports the logger, formats a concise message (including rule identifier, offending entity, and timestamp), and logs at an appropriate severity level.  

All of these pieces are orchestrated within the **ViolationTrackingModule** namespace, keeping the public surface minimal (primarily the repository and the tracking function) while the heavy lifting resides in the child **GraphDatabaseAdapterIntegration**.

---

## Integration Points  

1. **Parent – ConstraintSystem** – The parent supplies the global graph‑persistence configuration. Because the parent already uses the same `GraphDatabaseAdapter`, the module inherits connection settings, transaction handling, and the automatic JSON export feature.  

2. **Sibling – LoggingModule** – Violation events are emitted to the logging subsystem. This shared dependency ensures that violation logs appear alongside other system logs, providing a unified observability layer.  

3. **Sibling – ValidationModule & ConstraintEngineModule** – These components generate the raw violation signals that `trackConstraintViolations` consumes. The shared adapter means that validation results and violation records are stored in the same graph, enabling cross‑module queries (e.g., “which validated entities have the most violations”).  

4. **Sibling – DashboardModule** – Consumes the aggregated violation data produced by the module to render real‑time dashboards. The aggregation API exposed by `ViolationRepository` is the contract between the two.  

5. **Child – GraphDatabaseAdapterIntegration** – Encapsulates the wiring logic (initialisation, error handling) for the adapter. This integration layer isolates the rest of the module from adapter lifecycle concerns, allowing the module to focus on business logic.  

All dependencies are expressed through well‑named interfaces (e.g., `IGraphDatabaseAdapter`, `ILogger`), making the module replaceable in tests or future refactors.

## Usage Guidelines  

- **Always use the repository** – Direct calls to `GraphDatabaseAdapter` from within the module are discouraged. Developers should interact with `ViolationRepository` to guarantee that any future schema changes remain transparent.  

- **Log every violation** – After invoking `trackConstraintViolations`, ensure that the call to the **LoggingModule** includes the rule identifier and a deterministic correlation ID. This practice aids in traceability across logs and graph data.  

- **Prefer aggregation over raw scans** – For dashboard or reporting purposes, call the repository’s aggregation methods rather than iterating over all raw violation nodes. This leverages the graph engine’s query optimiser and keeps performance predictable at scale.  

- **Register custom rules via the rule registry** – When extending the system with new constraints, add the rule implementation to the module’s rule registry (the exact API is not detailed but is implied by the “customizable violation tracking rules” observation). Do not modify the core `trackConstraintViolations` logic; instead, let the rule’s validation callback invoke it.  

- **Mind the volume** – Because the module is designed for high‑throughput scenarios, batch insertion (e.g., buffering multiple violations before calling `createViolation` in bulk) is recommended when processing large streams of events.  

- **Testing** – Mock `IGraphDatabaseAdapter` and `ILogger` interfaces to unit‑test the repository and tracking function in isolation. The child **GraphDatabaseAdapterIntegration** can be exercised separately with integration tests that verify JSON export sync behaviour.

### Summary Deliverables  

1. **Architectural patterns identified**  
   * Adapter pattern – `GraphDatabaseAdapter` abstracts the graph store.  
   * Repository pattern – `ViolationRepository` isolates data‑access logic.  
   * Layered architecture – distinct service, repository, and integration layers.  
   * Extensibility via a plug‑in/strategy‑like rule registry (custom violation rules).  

2. **Design decisions and trade‑offs**  
   * Centralising persistence through a single adapter reduces duplication but creates a tight coupling to the graph model; any major change to the graph schema must be coordinated across all siblings.  
   * Using a repository adds an indirection layer that improves maintainability at the cost of a modest performance overhead, which is acceptable given the module’s emphasis on scalable querying.  
   * Supporting customizable rules increases flexibility but introduces runtime validation complexity; careful versioning of rule definitions is required.  

3. **System structure insights**  
   * **ViolationTrackingModule** sits under **ConstraintSystem**, sharing the graph‑persistence foundation with siblings.  
   * Its child **GraphDatabaseAdapterIntegration** handles adapter lifecycle, keeping the main module free of low‑level concerns.  
   * Interaction flows: Validation/Engine → `trackConstraintViolations` → `ViolationRepository` → GraphAdapter → JSON export; simultaneously, LoggingModule receives log entries, and DashboardModule consumes aggregates.  

4. **Scalability considerations**  
   * The module is explicitly designed for “large volumes of data” and “high‑performance querying”. Leveraging the graph database’s native indexing and query optimisation is central to this claim.  
   * Data aggregation is performed within the graph layer, avoiding costly in‑memory post‑processing.  
   * Batch writes and asynchronous logging are recommended to minimise back‑pressure on the adapter during peak loads.  

5. **Maintainability assessment**  
   * Strong separation of concerns (adapter, repository, service) promotes easy refactoring and testability.  
   * Shared dependencies (adapter, logger) are well‑encapsulated via interfaces, allowing mock substitution in unit tests.  
   * The rule‑registration mechanism, while powerful, requires disciplined documentation to prevent rule drift.  
   * Overall, the module’s architecture balances extensibility with a clear, observable data‑flow, making it maintainable for future feature growth.
