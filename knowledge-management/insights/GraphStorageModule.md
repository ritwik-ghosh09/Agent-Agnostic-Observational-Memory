# GraphStorageModule

**Type:** Detail

The parent analysis suggests the existence of a GraphStorageModule, which is consistent with the modular approach implied by the integrations directory.

## What It Is  

The **GraphStorageModule** lives inside the *integrations* directory of the code‑base (e.g., `integrations/graph-storage/…`).  It is the concrete implementation that provides persistent storage for an individual graph.  The module is referenced directly by its parent, **GraphDatabaseManager**, which “contains” a GraphStorageModule instance.  In the broader hierarchy the GraphDatabaseManager is a sub‑component of *DockerizedServices* and works together with a **DataAccessLayer** that uses the `storage/graph-database-adapter.ts` file.  In short, GraphStorageModule is the storage‑backend piece that the manager relies on to read, write, and query graph data, while the surrounding architecture supplies adapters and higher‑level orchestration.

## Architecture and Design  

The observations point to a **modular architecture**: every graph gets its own dedicated storage module under the *integrations* folder.  This modularity is reinforced by the **GraphDatabaseManager** which “uses a modular approach, implying the existence of a standardized interface for graph storage modules.”  In practice the design resembles a **plug‑in (or strategy) pattern**—the manager interacts with any storage implementation that conforms to the shared interface, allowing different back‑ends (e.g., LevelDB, in‑memory, remote services) to be swapped without touching the manager logic.

Interaction flow can be visualised as:

```
DockerizedServices
│
└─ GraphDatabaseManager
   ├─ GraphStorageModule (integrations/…)
   └─ GraphDatabaseAdapter (storage/graph-database-adapter.ts)
```

The **GraphDatabaseAdapter** acts as a thin data‑access layer that translates manager calls into the concrete storage API exposed by GraphStorageModule.  Because the parent manager already leverages **Graphology** (a graph‑theory library) together with **LevelDB** for persistence, the storage module likely wraps LevelDB operations while presenting a Graphology‑compatible interface.  This separation keeps persistence concerns isolated from graph‑logic concerns, a classic **separation‑of‑concerns** design decision.

## Implementation Details  

While the source does not list individual classes or functions, the naming conventions give us a clear picture of the implementation scaffolding:

* **GraphStorageModule** – resides in the *integrations* directory and implements the storage contract required by GraphDatabaseManager.  Its responsibilities include initializing a LevelDB instance, persisting node/edge data, and exposing CRUD‑style methods that the manager can invoke.
* **GraphDatabaseAdapter** (`storage/graph-database-adapter.ts`) – provides the façade that the manager uses.  It likely contains methods such as `createNode`, `createEdge`, `findNode`, `removeEdge`, etc., delegating the heavy lifting to GraphStorageModule.
* **GraphDatabaseManager** – orchestrates higher‑level operations (e.g., transaction handling, batch imports) and holds a reference to a GraphStorageModule instance.  Because the manager “contains” the module, the lifecycle (initialisation, shutdown) of the storage backend is controlled centrally.

The modular approach means that each graph’s storage module can be instantiated with its own LevelDB directory, enabling isolation of data per graph.  The manager can therefore manage multiple graphs concurrently, each backed by a distinct GraphStorageModule instance.

## Integration Points  

* **Parent – GraphDatabaseManager** – The manager is the primary consumer of GraphStorageModule.  It creates the module, passes configuration (e.g., LevelDB path, Graphology schema), and calls its API via the GraphDatabaseAdapter.
* **Sibling – DataAccessLayer** – The DataAccessLayer also depends on `storage/graph-database-adapter.ts`.  It likely provides higher‑level query utilities that sit on top of the adapter, meaning both the manager and the data‑access layer share the same storage contract.
* **External Libraries** – The broader context mentions **Graphology** (graph manipulation) and **LevelDB** (persistent key‑value store).  GraphStorageModule therefore integrates these libraries, exposing Graphology‑friendly methods while persisting data through LevelDB.
* **DockerizedServices** – Because GraphDatabaseManager is a sub‑component of DockerizedServices, the storage module is ultimately packaged inside a Docker container.  This influences configuration (environment variables for DB paths) and deployment (container volume mounts for LevelDB data).

## Usage Guidelines  

1. **Instantiate via the Manager** – Developers should never create a GraphStorageModule directly; instead they should request a graph through GraphDatabaseManager, which will provision the appropriate storage module automatically.
2. **Respect the Interface** – All interactions with the storage layer must go through `GraphDatabaseAdapter`.  Direct calls to LevelDB or Graphology inside GraphStorageModule are considered implementation details and may change without notice.
3. **Isolation per Graph** – When configuring a new graph, provide a unique storage directory (or LevelDB namespace) so that each GraphStorageModule keeps its data isolated.  This avoids cross‑graph contamination and simplifies backup/restore.
4. **Lifecycle Management** – Ensure that the manager’s shutdown routine is called (e.g., `manager.close()`), which will in turn close the underlying LevelDB instances inside each GraphStorageModule.  Failure to do so can lead to corrupted DB files.
5. **Testing** – For unit tests, replace the concrete GraphStorageModule with a mock that implements the same interface.  Because the manager only depends on the interface, the plug‑in architecture makes swapping implementations trivial.

### Architectural patterns identified  
* **Modular / Plug‑in (Strategy) pattern** – interchangeable storage back‑ends via a common interface.  
* **Separation of Concerns** – distinct layers for storage (GraphStorageModule), adaptation (GraphDatabaseAdapter), and orchestration (GraphDatabaseManager).  

### Design decisions and trade‑offs  
* **Isolation per graph** gives strong data safety and easy multi‑tenant support, at the cost of higher disk usage (multiple LevelDB instances).  
* **Standardized interface** enables future back‑ends (e.g., cloud‑based stores) without changing manager logic, but introduces an abstraction layer that can add slight latency.  

### System structure insights  
* The hierarchy is **DockerizedServices → GraphDatabaseManager → GraphStorageModule**, with a sibling **DataAccessLayer** sharing the same adapter.  
* Storage modules live under **integrations/**, reinforcing the notion that they are optional components that can be added or replaced.  

### Scalability considerations  
* Because each graph has its own LevelDB store, horizontal scaling can be achieved by distributing different graphs across multiple containers or hosts.  
* The plug‑in design allows swapping LevelDB for a more scalable distributed store if the need arises, without rewriting manager logic.  

### Maintainability assessment  
* The clear separation between manager, adapter, and storage module makes the codebase **highly maintainable**; changes to persistence (e.g., upgrading LevelDB) stay confined to GraphStorageModule.  
* The modular directory layout (`integrations/`) simplifies onboarding of new storage implementations and keeps the codebase organized.  
* However, the lack of a single unified storage interface definition in the observations means developers must rely on documentation or code navigation to understand the exact contract, which could be a minor maintenance friction.

## Hierarchy Context

### Parent
- [GraphDatabaseManager](./GraphDatabaseManager.md) -- GraphDatabaseManager likely uses Graphology and LevelDB to provide persistence and data storage capabilities.

### Siblings
- [GraphDatabaseManager](./GraphDatabaseManager.md) -- The GraphDatabaseManager is mentioned in the Hierarchy Context as a sub-component of DockerizedServices, indicating its role in managing graph data.
- [DataAccessLayer](./DataAccessLayer.md) -- The GraphDatabaseManager uses the GraphDatabaseAdapter class in storage/graph-database-adapter.ts to manage graph database operations, indicating a need for a data access layer.
