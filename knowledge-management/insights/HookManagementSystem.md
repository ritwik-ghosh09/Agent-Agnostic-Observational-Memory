# HookManagementSystem

**Type:** SubComponent

HookManagementSystem uses a modular architecture, with separate modules for hook registration, dispatch, and configuration management, as seen in the hook-management-system.ts file.

## What It Is  

HookManagementSystem is a **sub‑component** that lives inside the `ConstraintSystem` package. Its implementation is spread across a handful of dedicated source files:

* **`hook-management-system.ts`** – the façade that wires together registration, dispatch and configuration handling.  
* **`hook-registry.ts`** – contains the `registerHook` and `unregisterHook` functions that add or remove hook entries.  
* **`hook-dispatcher.ts`** – implements the runtime hook‑dispatch mechanism that is invoked by events.  
* **`hook-logger.ts`** – provides the `logError` helper used to record registration‑ and dispatch‑time failures.  
* **`graphdb-adapter.ts`** – supplies persistence primitives such as `createHookConfiguration` and `getHookConfigurations` that store hook metadata in the shared graph database.

Together these files give HookManagementSystem the ability to **register**, **store**, **retrieve**, **dispatch**, and **unregister** hooks while persisting their configuration in the same graph database that the broader `ConstraintSystem` uses for constraints and violations.

## Architecture and Design  

The observations reveal a **modular architecture** built around clear separation of concerns:

1. **Registry pattern** – `hook-registry.ts` isolates the bookkeeping of active hooks. The `registerHook` function adds a hook to an internal collection, while `unregisterHook` removes it. This encapsulation prevents other parts of the system from mutating the hook list directly.

2. **Adapter pattern** – All persistence operations funnel through `graphdb-adapter.ts`. By exposing methods such as `createHookConfiguration` and `getHookConfigurations`, the adapter abstracts the underlying graph‑database API from the rest of HookManagementSystem. This mirrors the same adapter usage employed by sibling components (e.g., `ValidationModule` and `ViolationPersistenceModule`), reinforcing a consistent persistence strategy across the `ConstraintSystem` family.

3. **Observer‑like dispatch** – `hook-dispatcher.ts` reacts to system events and forwards them to the registered hooks. Although not explicitly named “observer”, the mechanism follows the classic publish/subscribe idea: events trigger the dispatcher, which iterates over the registry and invokes each hook.

4. **Logging cross‑cutting concern** – Errors occurring during registration or dispatch are funneled to `hook-logger.ts` via `logError`. Centralising error handling keeps the core logic clean and provides a single point for future enhancements (e.g., structured logging or metrics).

5. **Hierarchical composition** – The component is declared as a child of `ConstraintSystem` and **contains** `HookConfigurationStorage`. This hierarchical relationship shows that HookManagementSystem is both a consumer of the parent’s graph‑database services and a provider of configuration storage for its own child.

Overall, the design leans heavily on **separation of responsibilities** and **reuse of a common persistence adapter**, which yields a coherent internal structure while aligning HookManagementSystem with its siblings.

## Implementation Details  

### Registration & Unregistration  
* `registerHook` (in **`hook-registry.ts`**) accepts a hook definition (typically a callback and metadata) and records it in an in‑memory map. Immediately after insertion it calls `createHookConfiguration` from **`graphdb-adapter.ts`** to persist the configuration node.  
* `unregisterHook` performs the inverse: it removes the entry from the map and, if needed, deletes the corresponding graph node (the deletion call is implied by the symmetry of the registration flow).

### Configuration Persistence  
* `createHookConfiguration` (graphdb‑adapter) builds a graph node that captures hook identity, trigger conditions, and any static parameters.  
* `getHookConfigurations` (graphdb‑adapter) is invoked by `HookManagementSystem` to hydrate the registry on startup, ensuring that previously persisted hooks are re‑registered without manual intervention.

### Dispatch Mechanism  
* The **`hook-dispatcher.ts`** module exposes a function that is called whenever a system event occurs (e.g., a constraint validation result). It retrieves the relevant hook list from the registry and executes each hook’s callback in turn.  
* Errors thrown by a hook are caught locally and routed to `logError` (hook‑logger), preventing a single faulty hook from breaking the entire dispatch chain.

### Logging  
* `logError` (hook‑logger) standardises the error payload, attaching context such as hook identifier, event type, and stack trace. This function is the sole entry point for error reporting inside HookManagementSystem, simplifying downstream log aggregation.

### Interaction with Parent & Siblings  
* Because `ConstraintSystem` already owns a `GraphDatabaseAdapter`, HookManagementSystem re‑uses the same adapter instance. This shared dependency means that hook configuration nodes live alongside constraint validation results and violation nodes, enabling unified queries across the graph.  
* Sibling modules (`ValidationModule`, `ViolationPersistenceModule`) also call into `graphdb-adapter.ts` for their own data, illustrating a **common persistence contract** that all sub‑components respect.

## Integration Points  

1. **GraphDatabaseAdapter (`graphdb-adapter.ts`)** – The sole persistence gateway. HookManagementSystem calls `createHookConfiguration` and `getHookConfigurations`; any change to the adapter’s API would ripple through registration and startup logic.

2. **ConstraintSystem (parent)** – Provides the runtime context in which events are emitted. The dispatcher is typically wired to the same event bus that the constraint validation pipeline uses, ensuring hooks fire at the appropriate lifecycle moments.

3. **HookConfigurationStorage (child)** – Acts as a thin wrapper around the configuration persistence calls. It may expose higher‑level CRUD operations for external tooling (e.g., an admin UI) while delegating the low‑level graph writes to the adapter.

4. **Sibling Modules** – Although they do not call HookManagementSystem directly, they share the graph database and therefore must respect the same transaction boundaries. For example, a validation result stored by `ValidationModule` could be a trigger condition for a hook.

5. **Logging Infrastructure** – `hook-logger.ts` may be wired into a broader application logger (e.g., Winston, Bunyan). Developers extending HookManagementSystem should route any new error paths through `logError` to keep diagnostics consistent.

## Usage Guidelines  

* **Always persist through the adapter** – When adding custom hook metadata, call `createHookConfiguration` (or the higher‑level `HookConfigurationStorage` API) rather than writing directly to the graph. This guarantees schema consistency with other sub‑components.

* **Register before dispatch** – Hooks must be registered **prior** to any event that could trigger them. A common pattern is to invoke `registerHook` during application bootstrap, allowing `getHookConfigurations` to preload persisted hooks.

* **Handle errors inside callbacks** – Hook callbacks should be defensive; any uncaught exception will be captured by the dispatcher and logged via `logError`, but excessive failures can flood logs. Consider wrapping callback logic in try/catch if additional cleanup is required.

* **Unregister when no longer needed** – To avoid memory leaks or stale dispatches, call `unregisterHook` when a hook’s lifecycle ends (e.g., on module teardown). This also removes the persisted configuration, keeping the graph tidy.

* **Do not bypass the registry** – Direct manipulation of the internal hook map is discouraged. All interactions should go through `registerHook`/`unregisterHook` to keep the in‑memory state and persisted state in sync.

### Architectural patterns identified
1. **Modular architecture** – distinct files for registration, dispatch, persistence, and logging.  
2. **Registry pattern** – centralised hook bookkeeping (`hook-registry.ts`).  
3. **Adapter pattern** – `graphdb-adapter.ts` abstracts graph‑database operations.  
4. **Observer‑style dispatch** – event‑driven hook execution (`hook-dispatcher.ts`).  
5. **Cross‑cutting logging** – unified error handling via `hook-logger.ts`.

### Design decisions and trade‑offs
* **Persisting hook configuration in the graph database** gives a single source of truth and enables rich queries (e.g., “which hooks are attached to a given entity?”) but couples hook lifecycle to graph‑transaction performance.  
* **In‑memory registry** provides fast dispatch but requires a warm‑up step (`getHookConfigurations`) to rebuild state after a restart.  
* **Separate logger** isolates error handling, improving maintainability, yet adds another module that must be kept in sync with any changes to error‑payload structure.

### System structure insights
HookManagementSystem sits **one level below** `ConstraintSystem` and **above** `HookConfigurationStorage`. It shares the `GraphDatabaseAdapter` with its siblings, forming a cohesive persistence layer across the constraint domain. The component’s internal modules (registry, dispatcher, logger) are loosely coupled through well‑defined function interfaces, facilitating independent evolution.

### Scalability considerations
* Because hook dispatch runs in‑process and iterates over an in‑memory list, the cost scales linearly with the number of registered hooks. For very large hook sets, consider sharding the registry or introducing asynchronous dispatch (not currently observed).  
* Persistence operations rely on the graph database; write‑heavy scenarios (e.g., frequent dynamic hook registration) could pressure the DB’s transaction throughput. The design mitigates this by persisting only configuration data—not per‑event payloads.

### Maintainability assessment
The **clear modular split** and **single‑responsibility functions** make the codebase approachable. Reusing the `GraphDatabaseAdapter` across multiple sub‑components reduces duplication and centralises database knowledge. However, the reliance on an in‑memory registry means that any change to the startup hydration (`getHookConfigurations`) must be carefully tested to avoid state drift. Overall, the design favours **readability and extensibility**, with the main maintenance risk residing in the graph‑database schema evolution and the need to keep the registry‑persistence contract consistent.

## Hierarchy Context

### Parent
- [ConstraintSystem](./ConstraintSystem.md) -- The ConstraintSystem component utilizes a GraphDatabaseAdapter for persistence, which is a crucial aspect of its architecture. This adapter is responsible for storing and retrieving constraint validation results, entity refresh results, and hook configurations. The GraphDatabaseAdapter is implemented in the graphdb-adapter.ts file, which provides methods for creating, reading, updating, and deleting data in the graph database. For instance, the createConstraintValidationResult method in this file creates a new node in the graph database to store the result of a constraint validation. The use of a graph database allows for efficient querying and retrieval of complex relationships between entities, which is essential for the ConstraintSystem component.

### Children
- [HookConfigurationStorage](./HookConfigurationStorage.md) -- The createHookConfiguration method in graphdb-adapter.ts is used to store hook configurations, indicating a deliberate design choice to utilize a graph database for this purpose.

### Siblings
- [ValidationModule](./ValidationModule.md) -- ValidationModule uses the createConstraintValidationResult method in graphdb-adapter.ts to store validation results in the graph database.
- [ViolationPersistenceModule](./ViolationPersistenceModule.md) -- ViolationPersistenceModule uses the createConstraintViolation method in graphdb-adapter.ts to store constraint violations in the graph database.
- [GraphDatabaseAdapter](./GraphDatabaseAdapter.md) -- GraphDatabaseAdapter uses the createNode method to create a new node in the graph database, as seen in the graphdb-adapter.ts file.
