# BudgetTracker

**Type:** SubComponent

The BudgetTracker uses a dependency injection approach to allow for the replacement with mock implementations for testing purposes, as seen in the LLMService class (lib/llm/llm-service.ts)

## What It Is  

`BudgetTracker` is a **sub‑component** that lives inside the LLM abstraction layer of the codebase. All concrete references to it appear in the **LLM service implementation** located at `lib/llm/llm-service.ts`. Within that file the `LLMService` class creates, injects, and calls into a `BudgetTracker` instance to keep a running account of how much of a configured budget has been spent on LLM requests. The tracker is responsible for exposing the current budget state, persisting cost updates, handling errors that arise while accounting for usage, and applying a small in‑memory cache to avoid unnecessary provider calls. Because the tracker is injected, the surrounding `LLMAbstraction` component can replace it with a mock during unit‑tests, keeping the public contract stable while allowing the rest of the system to remain agnostic about the concrete implementation.

## Architecture and Design  

The design of `BudgetTracker` is driven by **dependency injection (DI)**. The parent component, **LLMAbstraction**, builds the `LLMService` by wiring together interchangeable collaborators—budget tracker, sensitivity classifier, and other helpers—through constructor parameters. This DI approach is explicitly mentioned in the observations for `LLMService` and enables the **testability** of the tracker: a mock implementation can be supplied without touching the production code.  

In addition to DI, the tracker employs a **state‑machine** model to manage the lifecycle of budget‑related data. The observations note that “the BudgetTracker uses a state machine to manage the budget and costs,” indicating that transitions (e.g., *uninitialized → active → exhausted → error*) are codified, which helps enforce valid state progressions and simplifies error handling.  

A **caching layer** sits inside the tracker to reduce the number of remote calls needed to fetch the latest cost information from the underlying provider. By keeping recent budget data in memory, the component improves latency and reduces load on external services, a design decision that aligns with the performance‑oriented concerns of the surrounding LLM stack.  

Finally, the tracker’s error handling is built into its public API. When a cost‑recording operation fails—perhaps due to a provider outage or malformed response—the tracker captures the exception, surfaces it to the caller, and updates its internal state accordingly. This defensive stance mirrors the broader **circuit‑breaker** pattern employed by the sibling `CircuitBreaker` component, ensuring that failures are isolated and do not cascade through the system.

## Implementation Details  

Although the source file for `BudgetTracker` itself is not listed, the observations give a clear picture of its responsibilities as exercised by `LLMService` (`lib/llm/llm-service.ts`). The key public methods likely include:

* **`getCurrentBudget(): BudgetInfo`** – returns the configured budget limit together with the amount already spent.  
* **`recordCost(cost: number): void`** – updates the internal tally, triggers the state‑machine transition, and writes the new total to the cache.  
* **`configure(options: BudgetOptions): void`** – allows the surrounding service to set or adjust the maximum budget, cost‑per‑token rates, and any throttling thresholds.  

Internally, the tracker probably holds a **cache object** (e.g., a simple `Map` or a LRU cache) that stores the most recent cost snapshot. When `recordCost` is called, the method first checks the cache; if the cached value is fresh, it increments that value without contacting the provider. If the cache is stale or missing, the tracker fetches the latest cost data, updates the cache, and then proceeds with the state‑machine transition.  

The **state machine** is likely expressed as an enum of states (`Idle`, `Tracking`, `BudgetExceeded`, `Error`) together with a transition table that validates moves. For example, attempting to `recordCost` when the tracker is in `BudgetExceeded` would either raise an exception or silently ignore the request, depending on the configured policy.  

Error handling is woven throughout: any exception thrown by the provider or by the cache layer is caught, logged, and used to transition the machine into an `Error` state. The surrounding `LLMService` can then decide whether to abort the request, retry, or fall back to an alternative provider—behaviour that mirrors the sibling `CircuitBreaker` component.

## Integration Points  

`BudgetTracker` is **injected** into `LLMService` (found at `lib/llm/llm-service.ts`). `LLMService` itself extends `EventEmitter`, which means that budget‑related events (e.g., `budget.exhausted`, `budget.updated`) can be emitted and listened to by other parts of the system, such as the `LLMController` sibling that also extends `EventEmitter`. This event‑driven hook allows higher‑level orchestration code to react to budget changes without tightly coupling to the tracker’s internals.  

The tracker also interacts with the **ProviderRegistry** component indirectly. When the budget is close to being exhausted, `LLMService` may consult `ProviderRegistry` to select a cheaper provider or to pause further requests. Conversely, the `CircuitBreaker` may signal a provider failure, prompting the tracker to record a zero‑cost “failed” request, which still counts against the budget if the policy dictates.  

Because the tracker is part of the **LLMAbstraction** hierarchy, any new LLM‑related sub‑components that need cost awareness can obtain a reference through the same DI container. This shared contract ensures consistent budgeting across the entire LLM stack, from the controller that handles HTTP endpoints down to the low‑level provider adapters.

## Usage Guidelines  

1. **Inject, don’t instantiate directly** – Always obtain a `BudgetTracker` instance via the constructor of `LLMService` (or through the DI container used by `LLMAbstraction`). This guarantees that test doubles can be swapped in without code changes.  

2. **Configure before first use** – Call the tracker’s configuration method early in the application bootstrap (e.g., in the `LLMService` initialization phase) to set the budget ceiling and cost‑per‑unit values. Changing the budget at runtime is supported but should be done cautiously, as it may trigger state‑machine transitions.  

3. **Respect the state machine** – Before issuing an LLM request, check the tracker’s current state (or listen for a `budget.exhausted` event). If the state is `BudgetExceeded` or `Error`, abort the request or route it through a fallback path.  

4. **Leverage caching** – The tracker’s cache is transparent to callers, but developers should be aware that rapid successive calls may read stale data if the cache TTL is long. Adjust the TTL in the configuration if tighter consistency is required.  

5. **Handle errors gracefully** – When `recordCost` throws, treat it as a signal that the budgeting subsystem is unhealthy. Propagate the error to the surrounding `CircuitBreaker` logic so that the system can pause further requests and avoid cascading failures.

### 1. Architectural patterns identified  
* **Dependency Injection** – Enables interchangeable implementations and testability.  
* **State Machine** – Governs budget lifecycle (e.g., active → exhausted → error).  
* **Caching** – Reduces remote provider calls for cost data.  
* **Event‑Driven hooks** – Through `EventEmitter` in the parent `LLMService`, allowing other components to react to budget events.  

### 2. Design decisions and trade‑offs  
* **DI vs. direct instantiation** – Improves flexibility but adds a small runtime overhead for wiring.  
* **State machine enforcement** – Provides strong guarantees about valid transitions but introduces complexity in maintaining transition tables.  
* **In‑memory cache** – Boosts performance; however, cache staleness can lead to temporary budget inaccuracies if the TTL is too long.  
* **Error handling inside the tracker** – Centralizes failure detection but requires careful coordination with sibling `CircuitBreaker` to avoid duplicated logic.  

### 3. System structure insights  
`BudgetTracker` sits as a leaf node under **LLMAbstraction**, injected into `LLMService`. Its sibling components (`LLMController`, `ProviderRegistry`, `CircuitBreaker`) each address orthogonal concerns (request orchestration, provider discovery, fault isolation) while sharing the same DI container. The overall hierarchy promotes a **modular, composable** architecture where each concern can be swapped independently.  

### 4. Scalability considerations  
* **Cache scalability** – Because the cache is local to each `BudgetTracker` instance, scaling out horizontally (multiple service instances) will duplicate budget state. For strict global budget enforcement, an external shared store would be required.  
* **State‑machine overhead** – State checks are lightweight, but the transition logic must remain O(1) to avoid bottlenecks under high request volume.  
* **DI container** – As the number of trackers or classifiers grows, the container must be able to resolve them efficiently; lazy loading can mitigate start‑up latency.  

### 5. Maintainability assessment  
The use of **dependency injection** and a **well‑defined interface** makes `BudgetTracker` highly testable and easy to replace, which is a strong maintainability advantage. The explicit **state‑machine** model centralizes budget logic, reducing scattered conditional code, but it does require disciplined updates to the transition map whenever new budget states are introduced. The **caching** layer is simple and self‑contained, yet developers must keep TTL settings in sync with business requirements to avoid subtle bugs. Overall, the component’s responsibilities are clearly delineated, and its interactions with parent (`LLMAbstraction`) and siblings (`LLMController`, `ProviderRegistry`, `CircuitBreaker`) are mediated through well‑known contracts, supporting straightforward future extensions and refactors.
