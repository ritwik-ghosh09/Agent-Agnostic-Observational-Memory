# ViolationTracker

**Type:** SubComponent

ViolationTracker implements a data model to represent violations, including fields such as violation type, severity, and timestamp, to facilitate efficient storage and querying of violation data.

## What It Is  

ViolationTracker is a **SubComponent** of the `ConstraintSystem` that is responsible for collecting, persisting, and exposing violation information generated throughout the content‑validation pipeline. Although the source repository does not list a dedicated file for the tracker, its logical placement is inside the `ConstraintSystem` tree, alongside sibling components such as `ContentValidator`, `EntityRefresher`, and `GraphDatabaseAdapter`. The component builds a **violation data model** that captures the *violation type*, *severity*, and *timestamp* for each incident. It offers a public **API** that other components call to report new violations, and it supplies a **dashboard** UI for visualising trends, statistics, and historical data.  

The tracker relies heavily on the `GraphDatabaseAdapter` (implemented in `storage/graph-database-adapter.ts`) for durable storage, while a **Redis cache** sits in front of the graph database to accelerate read‑heavy workloads. Two operational modes—*real‑time* and *batch*—allow callers to choose between immediate persistence (useful for low‑latency alerting) or deferred bulk writes (optimising throughput for high‑volume ingestion).  

In short, ViolationTracker is the central hub that turns raw validation outcomes from `ContentValidator` into actionable, queryable records and visual insights for downstream consumers.

## Architecture and Design  

The overall architecture follows a **layered, adapter‑centric** pattern. At the lowest level, the `GraphDatabaseAdapter` abstracts the underlying graph store (Neo4j, Amazon Neptune, etc.) behind a uniform `query` (and `update`) interface. ViolationTracker invokes this `query` method to **fetch** existing violation nodes and to **write** new ones, thereby decoupling the tracker from any specific graph‑database implementation. This is the classic *Adapter* pattern, explicitly mentioned in the hierarchy context.  

A **caching layer** sits between ViolationTracker and the graph adapter. By employing Redis, the component reduces the frequency of expensive graph queries, especially when rendering the dashboard or serving repeated real‑time look‑ups. The cache is a straightforward *Cache‑Aside* strategy: the tracker checks Redis first, falls back to the graph adapter on a miss, and writes the fresh result back to Redis.  

The support for *real‑time* vs. *batch* tracking reflects an implicit **Strategy** choice. Callers can select the appropriate mode via the tracker’s API, allowing the component to switch between immediate writes (real‑time) and buffered, bulk‑insert operations (batch). This design balances latency against throughput without requiring separate code paths.  

Finally, the **dashboard** constitutes a presentation layer that consumes the same data model exposed by the tracker’s API. Because the dashboard reads from the Redis cache first, it benefits from the same performance gains that other consumers enjoy. The overall flow can be visualised as:  

`ContentValidator → ViolationTracker API → (Redis cache ↔ GraphDatabaseAdapter) → Dashboard / External Consumers`

## Implementation Details  

*Data Model* – The tracker defines a lightweight entity (likely a TypeScript interface or class) with fields: `type: string`, `severity: enum`, and `timestamp: Date`. These attributes are chosen to enable efficient indexing in the graph database and to support time‑series analysis on the dashboard.  

*API Surface* – Although the exact method signatures are not listed, the observations state that ViolationTracker “provides an API for reporting and tracking violations.” Typical calls would include `reportViolation(violation: Violation)` and `getViolations(filter?: ViolationFilter)`. The API abstracts the underlying persistence mechanism, allowing callers such as `ContentValidator` to simply push a violation object.  

*Graph Interaction* – All persistence operations funnel through the `GraphDatabaseAdapter.query` method (see `storage/graph-database-adapter.ts`). For example, when a new violation is reported, the tracker may execute a Cypher/Gremlin query that creates a `Violation` node and links it to the relevant `Entity` node. Retrieval for the dashboard uses similar `query` calls, possibly with `MATCH` clauses that filter by `type`, `severity`, or time range.  

*Caching* – The Redis cache is accessed via a thin wrapper (not named in the observations) that implements `get(key)` and `set(key, value, ttl?)`. When a violation is inserted, the tracker invalidates or updates the relevant cache entry to keep the view consistent. Reads for the dashboard first attempt `redis.get(cacheKey)`; on a miss, the tracker falls back to `GraphDatabaseAdapter.query` and then populates Redis.  

*Tracking Modes* – In **real‑time** mode, `reportViolation` triggers an immediate `query` to persist the node and a cache update. In **batch** mode, violations are accumulated in an in‑memory buffer or a temporary Redis list; a background job (e.g., a scheduled worker) periodically flushes the buffer using bulk `UNWIND`‑style queries to minimise round‑trips to the graph store.  

*Dashboard* – The visualisation component consumes the tracker’s read API, likely via HTTP endpoints or internal method calls. It aggregates violation counts, severity distributions, and temporal trends, presenting them in charts that help users “understand and improve their entity content.” The dashboard’s data freshness depends on the chosen tracking mode and cache TTL.

## Integration Points  

1. **Parent – ConstraintSystem** – ViolationTracker lives inside `ConstraintSystem`, which orchestrates overall constraint enforcement. The parent component supplies configuration (e.g., Redis connection details, tracking mode defaults) and may expose the tracker’s API to higher‑level services.  

2. **Sibling – ContentValidator** – `ContentValidator` feeds validation results into ViolationTracker. When the validator finishes checking an entity, it calls the tracker’s `reportViolation` method, passing the violation details. This tight coupling ensures that any validation failure is immediately reflected in the violation store.  

3. **Sibling – EntityRefresher** – While EntityRefresher updates entity data in the graph, ViolationTracker may need to re‑query those entities to keep its cached violation view consistent after a refresh. The two siblings therefore share the same `GraphDatabaseAdapter` instance.  

4. **Sibling – GraphDatabaseAdapter** – All persistence and retrieval operations go through the adapter located at `storage/graph-database-adapter.ts`. This shared dependency provides a single point of change if the underlying graph database technology is swapped.  

5. **External – Redis** – The caching layer is an external service that the tracker configures at startup. Cache keys are derived from query parameters (e.g., `violations:entityId:2023-04`) to enable fine‑grained invalidation.  

6. **Consumer – Dashboard UI** – The dashboard reads through the same API used by other services, ensuring a single source of truth. It may also subscribe to a lightweight event stream (not mentioned but implied by “real‑time” mode) to refresh visualisations instantly when new violations arrive.  

Overall, ViolationTracker acts as a mediator between validation logic, persistent graph storage, and presentation/analysis tools, while leveraging shared infrastructure (adapter, Redis) provided by its siblings and parent.

## Usage Guidelines  

*When reporting* – Always invoke the tracker’s API rather than directly accessing the graph database. This guarantees that the Redis cache is kept in sync and that the selected tracking mode is honoured.  

*Choosing a tracking mode* – Use **real‑time** for low‑volume, latency‑sensitive scenarios (e.g., interactive editing or alerting). Switch to **batch** for high‑throughput ingestion pipelines where occasional latency is acceptable in exchange for reduced write pressure on the graph database.  

*Cache awareness* – If you perform bulk reads that bypass the tracker (e.g., custom analytics), make sure to respect the same cache keys or explicitly invalidate the Redis entries after any direct graph updates.  

*Extending the data model* – New violation attributes should be added to the core model (type, severity, timestamp) and indexed in the graph schema to preserve query performance. Avoid adding large, unindexed blobs; store such payloads elsewhere and reference them by ID.  

*Error handling* – The tracker should surface adapter errors (connection loss, query failures) through its API so that callers can implement retry or fallback logic. In batch mode, failed batch writes should be logged and re‑queued for later processing.  

*Testing* – Unit tests should mock the `GraphDatabaseAdapter` and Redis client, verifying that the tracker calls `query` and updates the cache appropriately. Integration tests should spin up a lightweight graph instance (or an in‑memory stub) and a Redis container to validate end‑to‑end behaviour.

### Architectural Patterns Identified  

| Pattern | Where Observed |
|---------|----------------|
| **Adapter** | `GraphDatabaseAdapter` abstracts Neo4j/Amazon Neptune (`storage/graph-database-adapter.ts`). |
| **Cache‑Aside** | Redis sits in front of the graph database; tracker checks cache first, falls back to adapter, then writes back. |
| **Strategy (Mode Selection)** | Real‑time vs. batch tracking modes are selected via the tracker’s API. |
| **Facade / API Layer** | ViolationTracker exposes a reporting/tracking API that hides persistence details. |
| **Dashboard (Presentation Layer)** | Visualisation component consumes the same API, reflecting a clear separation between data handling and UI. |

### Design Decisions & Trade‑offs  

* **Adapter vs. Direct DB Calls** – By delegating to `GraphDatabaseAdapter`, ViolationTracker gains portability across graph stores, at the cost of an extra abstraction layer that can obscure database‑specific optimisations.  
* **Caching with Redis** – Improves read latency and reduces graph load, but introduces cache‑coherency complexity, especially in batch mode where many writes may invalidate large key ranges.  
* **Dual Tracking Modes** – Provides flexibility; however, maintaining two code paths (immediate write vs. buffered bulk) increases the surface area for bugs and requires careful monitoring of batch flush schedules.  
* **Data Model Simplicity** – Limiting the model to type, severity, and timestamp keeps queries fast and indexes small, but may force external services to store supplemental context elsewhere.  

---

### System Structure Insights  

* The **ConstraintSystem** acts as the parent orchestration layer, configuring shared services (graph adapter, Redis) and exposing ViolationTracker as a sub‑component.  
* Sibling components (`ContentValidator`, `EntityRefresher`) all converge on the same `GraphDatabaseAdapter`, reinforcing a **single source of persistence truth**.  
* ViolationTracker’s **dashboard** provides a read‑only view, illustrating a classic separation of concerns: write‑heavy validation flow vs. analytics/visualisation consumption.  

---

### Scalability Considerations  

* **Horizontal Scaling** – Because persistence is delegated to a graph database that can be clustered, and Redis can be sharded, ViolationTracker can be instantiated behind a load balancer with multiple stateless instances.  
* **Batch Mode** – Enables bulk ingestion, reducing per‑violation transaction overhead and allowing the system to handle spikes in validation traffic.  
* **Cache Partitioning** – Proper key design (e.g., per‑entity or per‑time‑window) ensures that hot spots are evenly distributed across Redis nodes.  
* **Potential Bottlenecks** – Real‑time mode may saturate the graph DB under heavy load; monitoring query latency and scaling the underlying graph cluster is essential.

### Maintainability Assessment  

The component’s **clear separation** between API, caching, and persistence makes it relatively easy to reason about and modify. The reliance on well‑defined adapters and a simple data model further reduces coupling. However, the existence of two tracking modes and the need to keep Redis in sync with the graph store add **state‑management complexity**. Documentation of cache key conventions and batch‑flush schedules is crucial to avoid subtle bugs. Overall, with disciplined testing (unit + integration) and consistent use of the provided API, ViolationTracker should remain maintainable as the system evolves.

## Hierarchy Context

### Parent
- [ConstraintSystem](./ConstraintSystem.md) -- The ConstraintSystem component utilizes the GraphDatabaseAdapter, located in storage/graph-database-adapter.ts, for storing and retrieving graph data. This adapter provides a standardized interface for interacting with the graph database, allowing the ConstraintSystem to focus on its core logic without worrying about the underlying database implementation. By using this adapter, the system can easily switch between different graph databases if needed, making it more modular and flexible. For example, the GraphDatabaseAdapter's query method can be used to retrieve specific nodes or edges from the graph, as seen in the ContentValidationAgent's constructor, where it is used to fetch entity content for validation.

### Siblings
- [ContentValidator](./ContentValidator.md) -- ContentValidator uses the GraphDatabaseAdapter's query method to fetch entity content for validation, as seen in the ContentValidationAgent's constructor.
- [EntityRefresher](./EntityRefresher.md) -- EntityRefresher uses the GraphDatabaseAdapter's update method to refresh entity data in the graph database.
- [GraphDatabaseAdapter](./GraphDatabaseAdapter.md) -- GraphDatabaseAdapter uses a factory pattern to create instances of different graph database implementations, such as Neo4j or Amazon Neptune.
