# GraphCodeSetup

**Type:** Detail

The Graph-Code setup is described in the integrations/code-graph-rag/docs/claude-code-setup.md file, which provides details on the configuration of the Graph-Code MCP Server.

## What It Is  

**GraphCodeSetup** is the concrete configuration artifact that prepares the **Graph‑Code MCP (Model‑Control‑Plane) Server** for use inside the **CodeGraphRAG** integration. The primary source of the setup lives in the repository under  

```
integrations/code-graph-rag/docs/claude-code-setup.md
```

where the step‑by‑step instructions for wiring the MCP server are recorded. An overview of the broader Graph‑Code system that consumes this setup is documented in  

```
integrations/code-graph-rag/README.md
```

Both files sit inside the *code‑graph‑rag* integration package, indicating that **GraphCodeSetup** is a child component of the **CodeGraphRAG** parent. The higher‑level component **ManualLearning** also contains a reference to **GraphCodeSetup**, suggesting that the same configuration may be reused in manual‑learning workflows.

In short, **GraphCodeSetup** is the set of configuration directives, environment variables, and possibly small helper scripts that enable the Graph‑Code MCP server to be launched and discovered by the rest of the CodeGraphRAG pipeline.

## Architecture and Design  

The observations point to a **configuration‑driven integration pattern**. Rather than embedding server‑startup logic directly in code, the system relies on a markdown‑based guide (`claude-code-setup.md`) that describes how to provision the MCP server. This approach keeps the runtime architecture loosely coupled: the **CodeGraphRAG** component merely expects a correctly configured MCP endpoint, while the actual provisioning steps are externalized.

The design therefore follows a **separation‑of‑concerns** model:

1. **Graph‑Code MCP Server** – a standalone service that implements the model‑control‑plane for graph‑based code analysis.  
2. **GraphCodeSetup** – the declarative configuration (paths, environment variables, service URLs) that makes the MCP server reachable.  
3. **CodeGraphRAG** – the consumer that assumes the MCP server is available and interacts with it via defined APIs.

Because the same setup is referenced from both **ManualLearning** and **CodeGraphRAG**, the architecture encourages **reuse of configuration** across multiple higher‑level features. The hierarchy (“ManualLearning contains GraphCodeSetup”) implies that the configuration is treated as a shared asset rather than a duplicated block of code.

No explicit design patterns such as micro‑services or event‑driven messaging are mentioned in the source observations, so the analysis stays within the documented configuration‑centric approach.

## Implementation Details  

The only concrete implementation artefacts we can cite are the markdown files that describe the setup:

* **`integrations/code-graph-rag/docs/claude-code-setup.md`** – This document enumerates the steps required to launch the Graph‑Code MCP server. Typical items (based on the naming) likely include:
  * Setting environment variables for authentication keys and service ports.  
  * Defining a **`GRAPH_CODE_MCP_URL`** or similar endpoint that downstream components will read.  
  * Instructions for installing any required CLI tools or Docker images that host the MCP server.

* **`integrations/code-graph-rag/README.md`** – Provides the high‑level view of the Graph‑Code system, probably summarizing:
  * The role of the MCP server within the CodeGraphRAG pipeline.  
  * How the MCP server’s API contracts (e.g., `/graph`, `/code`) are consumed by CodeGraphRAG modules.  
  * Any required runtime dependencies (e.g., a Python virtual environment, a Java runtime) that the MCP server expects.

Because the observations do not list specific class names, functions, or code snippets, we cannot enumerate concrete implementation objects. However, the presence of a dedicated **docs** folder signals a **documentation‑first** implementation strategy: the source of truth for configuration lives outside the codebase, making the setup reproducible and version‑controlled alongside the integration itself.

## Integration Points  

The configuration described in **GraphCodeSetup** is a bridge between three logical layers:

1. **Graph‑Code MCP Server** – The service that must be started first. Its endpoint is exposed via the configuration files.
2. **CodeGraphRAG** – The primary consumer. It reads the configuration (likely through environment variables or a small helper module) to locate the MCP server and issue graph‑oriented queries.
3. **ManualLearning** – Another consumer that also includes **GraphCodeSetup**, indicating that manual‑learning workflows can invoke the same MCP server for code‑graph generation or analysis.

The integration is therefore **pull‑based**: downstream components pull the MCP server address from the shared configuration. No explicit event or message bus is referenced, so the coupling is limited to network‑level API calls. The mention of “similar approach to the Claude Code Setup for Graph‑Code MCP Server” in the hierarchy context suggests that there may be a precedent configuration (perhaps for a Claude‑based LLM) that the current setup mirrors, reinforcing the idea of a **template‑style configuration** reused across different LLM back‑ends.

## Usage Guidelines  

* **Follow the documented steps verbatim** – Since the only authoritative source is `claude-code-setup.md`, developers should execute the setup exactly as described (environment variable names, service URLs, Docker commands, etc.).  
* **Treat the MCP endpoint as immutable** – Once the server is running, downstream modules (CodeGraphRAG, ManualLearning) expect a stable URL. Changing it without updating the configuration will break the integration.  
* **Version‑control the markdown files** – Because the configuration lives in documentation, any change to the MCP server version or required parameters must be reflected in the markdown files and committed.  
* **Reuse across siblings** – Since both CodeGraphRAG and ManualLearning embed **GraphCodeSetup**, any improvement to the setup (e.g., adding a new environment variable) should be made in a single place to propagate automatically.  
* **Validate before deployment** – A simple health‑check script (if provided) should be run after the MCP server starts to confirm that the endpoint matches what the consuming components expect.

### Summary of Architectural Insights  

1. **Architectural patterns identified** – Configuration‑driven integration; separation of concerns between service provisioning (MCP server) and consumer logic (CodeGraphRAG, ManualLearning).  
2. **Design decisions and trade‑offs** – Centralising configuration in markdown keeps the system flexible and easy to update, but it relies on developers to keep documentation in sync with actual runtime requirements.  
3. **System structure insights** – GraphCodeSetup sits as a shared child of both CodeGraphRAG and ManualLearning, acting as a common contract for the Graph‑Code MCP server.  
4. **Scalability considerations** – Because the MCP server is an external service, scaling it independently (e.g., via container orchestration) does not affect the consuming components, provided the endpoint remains consistent.  
5. **Maintainability assessment** – High maintainability when documentation is accurate; low risk of code churn because changes are confined to configuration files rather than source code. However, any drift between docs and actual server deployment can introduce hidden bugs, so regular validation is essential.
