# CodingConventionManager

**Type:** SubComponent

The CodingConventionManager sub-component utilizes the GraphDatabaseManager to manage interactions with the graph database, including data storage and retrieval, to support its coding convention management.

## What It Is  

The **CodingConventionManager** is a sub‑component that lives inside the **CodingPatterns** component and is responsible for enforcing the project’s coding conventions.  All of its core logic is implemented by leveraging the **LLMService** class located at `lib/llm/llm-service.ts`.  By calling into this service, the manager can issue provider‑agnostic language‑model requests that drive analysis, suggestion, and validation of code style.  In addition to the LLM integration, the manager works directly with the **GraphDatabaseAdapter** and **GraphDatabaseManager** to persist and retrieve convention‑related metadata in the underlying graph database.  The component also collaborates with two sibling sub‑components—**DesignPatternAnalyzer** and **CodeQualityEvaluator**—to ensure that applied design patterns and overall code quality remain aligned with the defined conventions.  Internally, it delegates some of its responsibilities to a child component called **ConventionManager**, which also uses the same LLMService for model calls.

## Architecture and Design  

The architecture of the CodingConventionManager follows a **layered composition** model.  At the highest level it acts as an orchestrator that brings together three distinct service layers: (1) an LLM abstraction (`LLMService`), (2) a graph‑database abstraction (`GraphDatabaseAdapter`/`GraphDatabaseManager`), and (3) domain‑specific analyzers (`DesignPatternAnalyzer`, `CodeQualityEvaluator`).  The repeated use of `LLMService` across the sibling components (DesignPatternAnalyzer, CodeQualityEvaluator, GraphDatabaseManager) indicates a **shared service façade** that hides provider‑specific details and offers a uniform API for model interactions.  

The presence of the **GraphDatabaseAdapter** is a clear instance of the **Adapter pattern**: it provides a stable interface for the rest of the system while shielding callers from the concrete graph‑database client implementation.  The **GraphDatabaseManager** builds on top of this adapter to manage higher‑level concerns such as transaction handling, batch writes, and query orchestration.  By separating the low‑level adapter from the manager, the design enables independent evolution of database access logic without rippling changes to the convention‑management code.  

Within the CodingConventionManager itself, responsibilities are **delegated** to the child component **ConventionManager**.  This reflects a **composition over inheritance** approach: the parent sub‑component aggregates the child to encapsulate finer‑grained convention logic while retaining the ability to coordinate broader workflows (e.g., invoking the LLM, persisting results).  The overall design emphasizes **separation of concerns**, with each collaborator handling a single, well‑defined responsibility.

## Implementation Details  

The central implementation hinge is the call to `LLMService` in `lib/llm/llm-service.ts`.  The manager imports this class and uses its methods to perform “provider‑agnostic model calls,” meaning the same code path can target different LLM back‑ends (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic) without modification.  The LLMService, in turn, relies on the **GraphDatabaseAdapter** to store prompts, responses, and any derived metadata in the graph database, ensuring traceability of convention checks.  

Interaction with the graph database occurs through two cooperating classes.  The **GraphDatabaseAdapter** supplies low‑level CRUD operations (e.g., `createNode`, `runQuery`) while the **GraphDatabaseManager** orchestrates higher‑level workflows such as “store convention violation” or “retrieve historical convention decisions.”  The CodingConventionManager invokes the manager for these persistence tasks, thereby keeping its own code focused on decision logic rather than database mechanics.  

To validate that code conforms not only to stylistic rules but also to appropriate design patterns, the manager calls into **DesignPatternAnalyzer**.  This sibling component also uses `LLMService`, allowing it to ask the language model to evaluate whether a given pattern aligns with the project's conventions.  Similarly, **CodeQualityEvaluator** is consulted to perform broader quality assessments; its results are fed back into the convention‑management pipeline to prioritize fixes or suggest refactorings.  

The child **ConventionManager** mirrors the parent’s usage of `LLMService`, likely handling more granular tasks such as parsing LLM responses, mapping them to specific convention rules, or generating user‑facing messages.  By reusing the same service, both parent and child maintain a consistent interaction model with the LLM layer.

## Integration Points  

- **LLMService (`lib/llm/llm-service.ts`)** – The primary external service used for all model‑based analysis.  It abstracts away the concrete LLM provider, exposing a stable API that the CodingConventionManager, its child ConventionManager, and sibling components all consume.  
- **GraphDatabaseAdapter** – Provides the low‑level interface to the graph database.  Any component that needs to read or write graph data (CodingConventionManager, GraphDatabaseManager) does so through this adapter, guaranteeing a uniform data‑access contract.  
- **GraphDatabaseManager** – Offers higher‑level database orchestration (transaction handling, batch operations).  The CodingConventionManager leverages it for storing convention‑related entities, while other components (e.g., DesignPatternAnalyzer) may also depend on it for persisting analysis results.  
- **DesignPatternAnalyzer** – Integrated to verify that detected design patterns respect the coding conventions.  The manager invokes this sibling when a pattern is identified, feeding the LLM‑generated assessment back into its workflow.  
- **CodeQualityEvaluator** – Called to gauge overall code quality against the conventions.  Its output influences the manager’s prioritization of remediation actions.  
- **Parent Component (CodingPatterns)** – Holds the CodingConventionManager, meaning any higher‑level orchestration of pattern detection or convention enforcement starts at the parent and delegates down to this sub‑component.  The parent also benefits from the same graph‑database adapter strategy described for the manager.  

All these integration points are bound together by the shared reliance on `LLMService` and the graph‑database stack, creating a cohesive ecosystem where each piece can be swapped or upgraded independently.

## Usage Guidelines  

1. **Always route LLM interactions through `LLMService`** – Direct calls to a specific provider should be avoided.  Import `LLMService` from `lib/llm/llm-service.ts` and use its public methods; this ensures future provider changes remain transparent to the CodingConventionManager and its children.  
2. **Persist convention data via `GraphDatabaseManager`** – When storing violations, suggestions, or historical decisions, invoke the manager rather than the raw adapter.  This guarantees that transactional semantics and any batching logic are applied consistently.  
3. **Leverage sibling analyzers for comprehensive checks** – After a convention rule is evaluated, call `DesignPatternAnalyzer` to confirm pattern compliance and `CodeQualityEvaluator` to capture broader quality metrics.  The combined results should be aggregated before presenting feedback to developers.  
4. **Delegate fine‑grained rule handling to `ConventionManager`** – Keep the top‑level manager focused on orchestration.  Implement rule‑specific parsing, response formatting, or user‑message generation inside the child component, reusing the same `LLMService` instance to avoid duplicate configuration.  
5. **Respect the adapter contract** – When extending or replacing the graph database, only modify the `GraphDatabaseAdapter` implementation.  All callers, including CodingConventionManager, will continue to function unchanged, preserving system stability.

### Summary Items  

1. **Architectural patterns identified** – Adapter pattern (GraphDatabaseAdapter), Facade/Service abstraction (LLMService), Composition over inheritance (ConventionManager as child), Layered orchestration (parent‑child‑sibling collaboration).  
2. **Design decisions and trade‑offs** – Centralizing LLM calls through a single service simplifies provider swaps but creates a single point of failure; using an adapter for the graph DB isolates database specifics but adds an extra indirection layer; delegating to a child manager improves separation of concerns at the cost of slightly more complex call chains.  
3. **System structure insights** – The system is organized around a core **CodingPatterns** component that houses the **CodingConventionManager**; siblings share the same LLM and graph‑DB infrastructure, promoting reuse; the child **ConventionManager** encapsulates rule‑level logic, keeping the parent focused on workflow coordination.  
4. **Scalability considerations** – Provider‑agnostic LLM calls can be scaled horizontally by configuring `LLMService` with load‑balancing or async queues; the graph‑database adapter allows the underlying DB to be scaled (e.g., clustering) without code changes; however, the single `LLMService` instance may become a bottleneck if not instantiated per request or pooled.  
5. **Maintainability assessment** – High maintainability due to clear separation of concerns, well‑defined interfaces (adapter, manager, service), and reuse of shared services across siblings.  The main maintenance surface lies in the `LLMService` implementation and the `GraphDatabaseAdapter`; changes to these will propagate predictably thanks to the abstraction boundaries.
