<summary>v7.0 Health Monitoring Consolidation -- Phase 33</summary>

### Phase 33: Health Monitoring Consolidation

**Goal:** Replace the four-layer host watchdog stack and parallel readers of `.health/*.json` with a single coordinator process owning one HTTP-served Single Source of Truth on `localhost:3034`, exposing per-session keyed entries, enforcing a 10s p95 detection SLA, and eliminating sledgehammer auto-heals — such that the dashboard at `:3032`, the constraint dashboard at `:3030`, the statusline daemon, the prompt-hook, and the in-container `/api/health-verifier/status` endpoint all derive their answer from the SAME SoT and never disagree.

**Plans:** 15/15 plans complete

Plans:
**Wave 1**
- [x] 33-01-PLAN.md — Wave 0 foundation: extract `lib/utils/log-rotator.js` and create test harness scaffold (10 files under `scripts/__tests__/health-coordinator/`)
- [x] 33-02-PLAN.md — Coordinator skeleton: `scripts/health-coordinator.js` (Express on `0.0.0.0:3034`, in-memory state, 4 endpoints, EADDRINUSE handler) + launchd plist (NOT loaded yet)

**Wave 2** *(blocked on Wave 1 completion)*
- [x] 33-03-PLAN.md — Coordinator behavior: rules loader + check registry + 5s tick + Docker `.State.Health.Status` passthrough + per-check error isolation (R6)

**Wave 3** *(blocked on Wave 2 completion)*
- [x] 33-04-PLAN.md — Reporter conversion: reduce `health-verifier.js` and `statusline-health-monitor.js` to reporter mode; add `lsl_heartbeat` POST to `enhanced-transcript-monitor.js`

**Wave 4** *(blocked on Wave 3 completion)*
- [x] 33-05-PLAN.md — Reader migration: rewrite `health-prompt-hook.js`, dashboard backend (`server.js`, 4 routes), and constraint-monitor backend (`dashboard-server.js`, 2 routes) to fetch from coordinator

**Wave 5** *(blocked on Wave 4 completion)*
- [x] 33-06-PLAN.md — Rules cleanup: delete `bind_mount_freshness` and `supervisord_status` from `health-verification-rules.json`; delete `refreshBindMounts()` and any `--force-recreate` from `health-remediation-actions.js`
- [x] 33-07-PLAN.md — Cutover: add `HEALTH_COORDINATOR_URL` to `docker-compose.yml`; rebuild container; delete 4 legacy daemon scripts; bootout legacy plist + bootstrap new plist; clean stale `.health/*.json`; human verify

**Wave 6** *(blocked on Wave 5 completion)*
- [x] 33-08-PLAN.md — Acceptance: run all 13 SPEC AC checks against the cutover system; write `33-VERIFICATION-PRECHECK.md`; human verify

**Gap closure (from 33-08 acceptance failures, 6 plans):**

**Wave 1 (gap-closure parallel — disjoint files)**
- [x] 33-09-PLAN.md — G1 (HIGH): port liveness probes (HTTP + TCP) into coordinator's check registry; add `obs_api` rule so AC#6 detection-latency test can find it. Touches `scripts/health-coordinator.js`, NEW `lib/utils/service-probe.js`, NEW `scripts/__tests__/health-coordinator/service-liveness.test.sh`
- [x] 33-10-PLAN.md — G2 (HIGH): mount `/api/*` reverse-proxy in `integrations/system-health-dashboard/static-server.js` BEFORE the SPA `*` catch-all so port 3032 returns JSON for `/api/health-verifier/*`. Unblocks AC#5 and AC#9
- [x] 33-12-PLAN.md — G7 (HIGH, NEW from 33-08): declare `HEALTH_COORDINATOR_INJECT_THROW` (and friends) in plist `EnvironmentVariables` dict so `launchctl setenv` overrides reach child process. Unblocks AC#13. Includes human-verify checkpoint
- [x] 33-14-PLAN.md — G5+G6+G8 (LOW bundle): cleanup stale refs in `free-coding-ports.sh`; remove `--auto-heal` from `start-services-robust.js` spawn; bump `eviction.test.sh` sleep 17s→22s; remove `start_global_lsl_monitoring` no-op stub from `agent-common-setup.sh`

**Wave 2 (gap-closure — depends on 33-09 because both touch `scripts/health-coordinator.js`)**
- [x] 33-11-PLAN.md — G4 (MED): rename `pollDockerHealth()` output key `status` → `healthcheck` to match SPEC AC #4 / AC #12 jq paths AND existing readers (statusline daemon, dashboard reshape). Unblocks AC#4 + AC#12

**Wave 3 (gap-closure — depends on 33-09 + 33-11; option-c may touch `scripts/health-coordinator.js`)**
- [x] 33-13-PLAN.md — G3 (MED): canonical session-id form for LSL keying — **starts with `checkpoint:decision`** (4 options: ETM normalizes / per-pane reads env / coordinator fuzzy / project-rollup canonical). Includes human-verify checkpoint for two-pane tmux scenario

**Acceptance gate after gap-closure:** re-run `bash scripts/__tests__/health-coordinator/run-all.sh` + re-execute plan 33-08's acceptance suite. Phase 33 declared complete when SPEC AC pass count goes from 7 → 13 (or 13 with documented deviations for AC#2 LLM-CLI-proxy out-of-scope).

### Phase 34: Proxy Supervision and ETM Legacy Cleanup

**Goal:** Close real LLM proxy supervision gaps in the central health coordinator (semantic-work probe, central network-mode publishing, on-the-fly VPN/CN re-detection, auto-heal wiring) AND execute the deferred Option B from commit 0049fc179 — delete the dead `StreamingKnowledgeExtractor` / `RealTimeTrajectoryAnalyzer` / related modules that the ETM still runs (2 LLM calls per exchange + 1 per prompt set, output unread since the [📚] badge rewire) — so the coordinator becomes the honest single source of truth for proxy semantic-readiness AND the ETM hot path stops doing dead work.

**Plans:** 6 plans

Plans:

**Wave 1 (parallel — disjoint files)**
- [x] 34-01-PLAN.md — Update llm_cli_proxy rule in config/health-verification-rules.json: flip auto_heal=true + add cooldown 3/5min (D-06 + D-07 kill-switch via existing POST /health/refresh)
- [x] 34-02-PLAN.md — Add state.proxy slice + pollProxySemantic (60s, D-01 payload, D-02 four-mode classification) + pollProxyMode (every tick) to scripts/health-coordinator.js — observation only, no FSM
- [x] 34-04-PLAN.md — ETM strip (D-08 Plan A): delete ~80 LoC of dead online-learning paths from scripts/enhanced-transcript-monitor.js + checkpoint cross-project ETM smoke verify (D-09 + D-10) — cherry-picked clean from `worktree-agent-a2ca353f2ad671350`; auto-merge resolved both 34-04's strip and this session's per-exchange tranche routing + lock fix; structural grep gates pass; live ETM smoke (D-09/D-10 hard-restart with prompt-flow check) deferred to operator window since the plan is `autonomous: false`
- [x] 34-06-PLAN.md — Phase 33 leftover closure: AC #6 detection-latency P95 ≤ 10s + AC #11 destructive kill -9 respawn ≤ 30s + plist dead-key cleanup (D-15 + D-16 + D-17) — Option B applied; bootout/bootstrap re-applied plist (uptime 4326s → 3s); AC #6 PASS (50 trials, both assertions green); AC #11 PASS (1s respawn vs 30s threshold); Phase 33 re-run halts on pre-existing two-session-agreement test-side bug from `8f304038e` compound-key migration — NOT a 34-06 regression; D-14 24h soak gate PENDING by design (post-merge)

**Wave 2** *(depends on Wave 1 — Plan 34-03 reads RULES from 34-01 + adds FSM on top of 34-02; Plan 34-05 deletes files orphaned by 34-04 + surfaces state.proxy from 34-02)*
- [x] 34-03-PLAN.md — Auto-heal FSM (D-06 cooldown) + VPN/CN flap kickstart (D-05) wired into pollProxySemantic + pollProxyMode; rewrite restartLLMCLIProxy() in scripts/health-remediation-actions.js to use launchctl kickstart -k (PATTERNS.md anomaly #3) — Task 1 PID-change + D-07 kill-switch verified live; R3/R4 destructive tests deferred per SUMMARY operator runbook
- [x] 34-05-PLAN.md — ETM Plan B + surface: delete 6 source files + clean dead readers in scripts/combined-status-line.js (Task 2(d) closed 2026-05-11 — methods 1+2 refactored to PSM-only; method 3 sync-constraint deferred; net -54 LoC) + add [🧠] proxy badge (collision-resolved with UKB indicator per anomaly #1) + add LLM Proxy Health card to system-health-dashboard (D-11 + FUSE caveat); W-1 live tmux render operator-verified 2026-05-11

### Phase 35: Observation & Digest Retention with JSON Cold-Store Fallback

**Goal:** Cap the SQLite `observations` and `digests` tables to a configurable retention window (default 7 days) while transparently merging older rows from `.data/observation-export/{observations,digests}.json` on dashboard queries so historical data stays browsable. Insights table untouched (long-term memory for prompt injection).

**Plans:** 5 plans across 3 waves

Plans:

**Wave 1 (parallel — disjoint files)** — DONE 2026-05-15
- [x] 35-01-PLAN.md — `retentionDays: 7` added to `.observations/config.json`; `ObservationWriter` exposes `this.retentionDays` with constructor-time throw on `< 1` (CONTEXT.md L4 dedup-floor invariant); 5-case Jest suite; also restored empty `test/setup.js` blocker (Rule-3 deviation, noted in SUMMARY) — commits `c470b8c05` + `b16f5ca2a` + SUMMARY `0c0500fe9`
- [x] 35-03-PLAN.md — `ColdStoreReader` read-only range query over `.data/observation-export/{observations,digests}.json` with day-bucketed LRU + fresh-rows-Map decoupling for windows larger than cacheSize; 7-case Jest suite includes source-grep invariant #3 (zero write-API references); commits `47cd10b9f` + `cbd32dd86` + `97ef09118` + SUMMARY `121b02dfc`

**Wave 2** *(sequenced — 35-04 wires both into obs-api)*
- [x] 35-02-PLAN.md — `ObservationPruner` module landed: stateless class, duck-typed DB handle, single transactional `.prune()`; FTS5 trigger drives `observations_fts` sync transparently; 5-case Jest suite (HAS_FTS5-gated) including source-grep invariant #2 — commits `f7ef097fd` + `3fcff881a` + SUMMARY `249954ea0`
- [ ] 35-04-PLAN.md — Wire pruner + reader into `scripts/observations-api-server.mjs`: 1h pruner interval on boot; `/api/observations` + `/api/digests` merge SQLite + ColdStoreReader rows on `offset === 0` when `from` is older than retention boundary (Option B — SQLite-only on `offset > 0` preserves pagination semantics); requires `launchctl kickstart` of obs-api to deploy

**Wave 3**
- [ ] 35-05-PLAN.md — Dashboard backend pass-through verify (`_forwardObsApi` byte-pipe is shape-agnostic, no code change required) + add non-mutating `JSON.parse` tap that logs `[Dashboard:ColdStore]` when `_metadata.fromColdStore === true`, preserving byte-for-byte body fidelity; FUSE-cache-aware rollout via `docker-compose restart coding-services`

### Phase 36: token-usage per-user hourly exports (mirror LSL conventions for git-trackable JSON)

**Goal:** Eliminate merge conflicts on the monolithic `.data/llm-proxy-export/token-usage.json` (637 KB, 1457 rows) by adopting the LSL filesystem convention — per-(date, time-window, user-hash) JSON files under `YYYY/MM/` — so multiple users sharing the project via git can each push their own hourly token-usage snapshots without colliding. Backed by a `user_hash`-discriminated SQLite schema (`UNIQUE (user_hash, id)`) and always-on `hydrateFromExports()` that ingests peers' files on every proxy boot via `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`. Closes the "DB still dirty" symptom by widening `.gitignore` to cover SQLite WAL/SHM.

**Requirements**: N/A (no .planning/REQUIREMENTS.md in this project; coverage gate satisfied by CONTEXT.md decisions + PATTERNS.md landmines)
**Depends on:** Phase 35
**Plans:** 7/7 plans executed ✅
**Status:** Complete (2026-05-16)

Plans:

**Wave 1 (parallel — disjoint files)**
- [x] 36-01-PLAN.md — Coordinator publishes `currentState.lsl_meta.current_window` at `/health/state` (HHMM-HHMM, via `getTimeWindow(utcToLocalTime(new Date()))`, cached `sessionDurationMs`, R6 'unknown' on error). Touches `scripts/health-coordinator.js` only.
- [x] 36-02-PLAN.md — `_work/rapid-llm-proxy/bin/start-llm-proxy.sh` exports `LLM_PROXY_USER_HASH` before `exec node` (ESM `import()` of `scripts/user-hash-generator.js`, regex-validated, fallback to `'unknown'`). Wrapper IS what launchd invokes — `bin/coding` is NOT modified.

**Wave 2** *(depends on Wave 1 — needs both coordinator window publish AND env-side hash)*
- [x] 36-03-PLAN.md — Proxy writer rewrite in `_work/rapid-llm-proxy/src/token-usage.ts`: `resolveTokenExportDir`, `currentWindow` (coordinator-curl with 30s cache + local fallback, module-init warm), `exportToHourFile` (right-exclusive `[windowStart, windowEnd)` SELECT + `(user_hash, id)` safety-merge), per-window-keyed `Map<windowKey, Timer>` debounce. Defensive `// TODO(36-04)` fallback for the pre-migration SELECT. Build + kickstart.

**Wave 3** *(depends on Wave 2 — adds schema + replaces hydrate path on the same file)*
- [x] 36-04-PLAN.md — Schema migration in `initTokenDb`. Plan defect discovered during execution: SQLite refuses `ON CONFLICT(user_hash, id)` while `id` is `INTEGER PRIMARY KEY` (ROWID-aliased). User authorised composite-PK rebuild path: `PRIMARY KEY (user_hash, id)` instead of UNIQUE INDEX, INSERT OR IGNORE instead of ON CONFLICT, JS-managed `handle.nextLocalId()` instead of AUTOINCREMENT. Retag folded into the COPY's SELECT. Always-on `hydrateFromExports` (recursive walker port). Remove Plan 36-03's defensive fallback. Build + kickstart. Cross-user simulation verified.

**Wave 4** *(depends on Waves 2+3 — filesystem cleanup after the proxy can write/read the new layout)*
- [x] 36-05-PLAN.md — Two-commit close: (a) `.gitignore` adds explicit `*.db-wal` / `*.db-shm` / `*.db-journal` lines, preserves `!.data/llm-proxy-export/` allow-list, lands as own commit FIRST; (b) NEW `scripts/migrate-token-usage-export.mjs` (one-shot, --dry-run, idempotent) buckets the legacy monolithic file into per-(date, window, user) files under YYYY/MM/, deletes the monolith in the same commit. Idempotent re-run prints `monolith already removed`.

**Wave 5 (parallel — disjoint files, polish)** *(36-06 depends_on 36-04 for server.mjs co-edit ordering; 36-07 fully independent)*
- [x] 36-06-PLAN.md — Model-name canonicalization at the proxy persistence boundary. `canonicalizeModelName(raw)` pure function + `MODEL_CANONICAL_MAP` (17 entries) defined ABOVE `_tokenDb` init (TDZ fix). `model_raw TEXT` column via PRAGMA-guarded ALTER. Idempotent backfill at proxy init rewrote 1027 pre-existing rows (matches variant-table sum exactly); second boot scans 0. Dashboard "By Model" panel collapsed from 8 Claude rows to 3.
- [x] 36-07-PLAN.md — Treemap hover tooltip in `integrations/system-health-dashboard/src/pages/token-usage.tsx`. Add `TreemapTooltip` custom component (process / total / in-out split / calls / avg latency) wired as `<Tooltip content={...}>` child of the existing `<Treemap>` at line ~354 — currently NO Tooltip is wired and the "Hover for details" subtitle is aspirational. Plus SVG `<title>` inside `TreemapContent` for native-browser/screen-reader fallback. Browser-verified via /playwright-cli per CLAUDE.md E2E memory.

## Backlog

### Phase 999.1: Extract Shared LLM Adapter Library (BACKLOG)

**Goal:** Extract `lib/llm/` to a shared submodule used by coding and rapid-automations/OKB. Add direct HTTP path for Claude Max (OAuth token from keychain -> Anthropic API, no CLI spawn) to eliminate 12-15s latency. Copilot provider already does direct HTTP (~2-5s) -- same pattern for claude-code.
**Requirements:** TBD
**Plans:** 0 plans

Plans:
- [ ] TBD (promote with /gsd-review-backlog when ready)
