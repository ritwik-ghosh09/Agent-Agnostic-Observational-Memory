# Coding Project — Knowledge Management

## What This Is

An agentic coding environment with multi-agent support (Claude, Copilot, OpenCode, Mastracode), live session logging, real-time observational memory, semantic knowledge management, and a health dashboard. v1.0-v2.1 shipped the UKB analysis pipeline. v3.0 added workflow state machine. v4.0 integrated mastra.ai's observational memory alongside LSL, added mastracode as a fourth coding agent, and built transcript converters + a live observation dashboard. v5.0 overhauled service reliability and health monitoring.

## Core Value

A self-learning coding environment that captures every session, builds knowledge, prevents mistakes, and makes observations browsable — across all AI coding agents.

## Current State

**v6.0 shipped.** Knowledge context injection is live across all four coding agents. Every `coding` session automatically receives relevant knowledge from the accumulated observation/digest/insight/KG database via Qdrant semantic search, with per-agent scoring profiles and cross-agent session continuity. Working memory provides a 300-token project state prefix on every retrieval response.

Stack: Four coding agents (`coding --claude/--copilot/--opencode/--mastra`), live ETM observations, Qdrant vector search, hybrid retrieval (semantic + keyword + recency), Redis pub/sub for write-time embedding, per-agent adapters, session state handoff.

## Requirements

### Validated

- ✓ Write-time auto-embedding via Redis pub/sub — Phase 28

- ✓ POST /api/retrieve on health API (port 3033), <500ms latency — Phase 29

### Shipped in v6.0 (continued)

- ✓ Claude UserPromptSubmit hook with fail-open design — Phase 30
- ✓ Cross-project hook (global settings), all 4 agent adapters — Phase 30.1
- ✓ Context-aware relevance boosting (project, cwd, recent files) — Phase 30.1
- ✓ Working memory (KG structure + STATE.md, 300-token budget) — Phase 31
- ✓ Per-agent scoring profiles (tier weight multipliers) — Phase 32
- ✓ Cross-agent session continuity (session state file, 2-hour window) — Phase 32

### Active

(Next milestone not yet defined — run `/gsd-new-milestone`)

### Shipped in v4.0

- ✓ Mastracode agent integration (`coding --mastra`) — Phase 21
- ✓ Transcript-to-observation converters (Claude, Copilot, Specstory) — Phase 22
- ✓ Historical LSL batch converter (git-tracked .specstory files → observations) — Phase 22
- ✓ Live observation tap (ETM fire-and-forget per exchange) — Phase 23
- ✓ Observations dashboard (REST API + React page with FTS search) — Phase 23
- ✓ LLM proxy bridge for observer/reflector agents — Phase 20

### Out of Scope

- v1.0 deferred work (significance scoring) — revisit after v2.0
- Changing the MCP server interface — `ukb full` invocation stays the same
- Agent framework rewrite — extend existing coordinator, don't rewrite
- Real-time pipeline monitoring — v2+ concern

## Context

- **Pipeline location:** `integrations/mcp-server-semantic-analysis`
- **Knowledge graph storage:** `.data/knowledge-graph/` (Graphology + LevelDB + JSON exports)
- **Export file:** `.data/knowledge-export/coding.json` (30 entities, hierarchical L0→L3)
- **VKB viewer:** `vkb` command, runs on http://localhost:8080
- **Key interface:** `KGEntity` in `kg-operators.ts` — hierarchy fields (parentId, level, hierarchyPath)
- **Component manifest:** `config/component-manifest.yaml` — 8 L1 + 5 L2 components
- **Current pipeline:** DAG steps in `coordinator.ts` — batch extraction → observation synthesis → persistence
- **Current problem:** Entities have 1 banal observation each, 2-3 sub-nodes per component (should be many more)

## Constraints

- **Storage:** Must work with existing Graphology + LevelDB infrastructure
- **Interface:** `ukb full` / `mcp__semantic-analysis__execute_workflow` must remain unchanged
- **Architecture:** Extend existing coordinator; add wave orchestration on top of DAG
- **Backward compat:** VKB viewer must still display entities even if hierarchy features aren't fully loaded
- **Build pipeline:** Submodule build + Docker rebuild required for pipeline changes

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Fix existing pipeline, not redesign | Pipeline worked before — architecture is sound | ✓ Good |
| Keep batched execution mode | Working and wanted | ✓ Good |
| Defer v1.0 Phases 2-3 | Pipeline quality is good enough; hierarchy is higher priority | ✓ Good (shipped v1.0) |
| All hierarchy fields optional (?) | Full backward compatibility | ✓ Good |
| Replace flat DAG with wave-based agents | Flat pass produces shallow knowledge; waves produce depth | — Pending |
| Wave-per-level architecture | Each wave operates at one hierarchy level, spawns next | — Pending |
| Rich observations + insight docs per entity | One-liner observations are insufficient for useful knowledge | — Pending |

## Evolution

This document evolves at phase transitions and milestone boundaries.

**After each phase transition** (via `/gsd:transition`):
1. Requirements invalidated? → Move to Out of Scope with reason
2. Requirements validated? → Move to Validated with phase reference
3. New requirements emerged? → Add to Active
4. Decisions to log? → Add to Key Decisions
5. "What This Is" still accurate? → Update if drifted

**After each milestone** (via `/gsd:complete-milestone`):
1. Full review of all sections
2. Core Value check — still the right priority?
3. Audit Out of Scope — reasons still valid?
4. Update Context with current state
