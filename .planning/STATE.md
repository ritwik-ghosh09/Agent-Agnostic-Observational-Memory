# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-24)

**Core value:** A self-learning coding environment that captures every session, builds knowledge, prevents mistakes, and makes observations browsable -- across all AI coding agents.
**Current focus:** Phase 36 — token-usage-per-user-hourly-exports-mirror-lsl-conventions-f

## Current Position

Phase: 36 — COMPLETE
Plan: 1 of 5
Status: Phase 36 complete
Last activity: 2026-05-16 -- Phase 36 marked complete

Progress: [██████████] 100%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 27 (v6.0)
- Average duration: 3 min
- Total execution time: 0.05 hours

*Updated after each plan completion*

## Accumulated Context

### Roadmap Evolution

- Phase 30.1 inserted after Phase 30: Cross-Project Agent-Agnostic Knowledge Injection (URGENT) — make injection work across all projects and agents with focused relevance
- Phase 36 added: token-usage per-user hourly exports (mirror LSL conventions for git-trackable JSON)

### Decisions

- [v6.0 start]: Agent-agnostic architecture -- retrieval service is standalone HTTP API, each coding agent has its own adapter
- [v6.0 start]: Use existing Qdrant instance for vector storage (not LibSQL vector)
- [v6.0 start]: All four knowledge tiers as sources (observations, digests, insights, KG entities)
- [v6.0 start]: Mastra-inspired but adapted -- their Observer/Reflector pattern maps to our existing ETM/consolidation pipeline
- [v6.0 roadmap]: Embedding pipeline is strict foundation -- nothing works without vectors in Qdrant
- [v6.0 roadmap]: Retrieval service runs host-side (not Docker) to avoid SQLite WAL lock contention
- [v6.0 roadmap]: Claude hook is primary adapter -- prove value before other agents
- [v6.0 roadmap]: fastembed with all-MiniLM-L6-v2 (384-dim) pinned as embedding model
- [v6.0 roadmap]: Token budget default ~1000 tokens (research recommends 800-1000, not the 2K initially planned)
- [28-01]: EmbeddingModel.AllMiniLML6V2 enum verified at runtime; queryEmbed returns Float32Array converted via Array.from()
- Deterministic UUID from KG entity keys via MD5 hash for Qdrant point IDs
- Fire-and-forget Redis publish with fail-fast retryStrategy ensures observation writes never block on embedding
- Plain JS for src/retrieval/ modules to match server.js consumer and avoid TS compilation step
- Import compiled dist/embedding/ outputs from retrieval modules (not raw src/embedding/ TS)
- Added src/retrieval bind-mount to docker-compose.yml for retrieval modules in Docker
- Set absolute cacheDir in FlagEmbedding.init() to prevent CWD-relative model loading
- Reset _initPromise on failure for retry support in RetrievalService
- [30-01]: Plain JS hook with MIN_WORDS=4 threshold, fail-open HTTP with 2s timeout + 5s safety ceiling
- Cumulative context boost factors (1.15 project, 1.10 cwd, 1.20 recent_files) for relevance scoring
- Claude hook moved to global settings for cross-project firing; Copilot adapter uses AUTO-KNOWLEDGE markers for safe file merging
- Working memory (300-token KG+state prefix) integrated into retrieve() pipeline with fail-open VKB fetch and STATE.md parsing
- Per-agent RRF scoring profiles: agent identity flows from adapters through context.agent to rrf-fusion for two-pass tier weighting
- Session state written to .coding/session-state.json with 2-hour staleness window for cross-agent continuity
- [33-05]: Three consumer migrations done — prompt-hook + system-health-dashboard + constraint-monitor dashboard all fetch /health/state from coordinator instead of readFileSync of `.health/*.json`. SPEC AC #7 grep gate clean. Coordinator unreachable surfaces as `overallStatus: 'unknown'` (NEVER 'healthy'). Q3 graceful no-op preserved when prompt-hook is invoked outside the coding repo (empty additionalContext). Dashboard frontend `dist/` NOT rebuilt — backward-compat preserved per SPEC R8.
- [Phase ?]: [36-07]: TreemapTooltip uses recharts <Tooltip content={...}/> child-of-Treemap pattern; SVG <title> as native-browser/screen-reader fallback for sub-60x40 boxes

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 28]: Verify Docker base image supports fastembed (requires glibc/Debian, not Alpine)
- [Phase 32]: OpenCode plugin injection API needs runtime validation before implementation
- [Phase 32]: Copilot per-prompt injection may not be supported -- may need refresh daemon approach
