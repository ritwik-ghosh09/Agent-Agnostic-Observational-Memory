# LSL - Live Session Logging

Real-time conversation monitoring and intelligent classification that captures every development session with zero data loss.

## What It Does

The LSL system provides **intelligent session capture** with automatic content routing:

- **Real-Time Monitoring** - Captures every coding agent conversation as it happens
- **Intelligent Classification** - 5-layer system determines content routing (LOCAL vs CODING)
- **Zero Data Loss** - Multi-layer supervision with automatic recovery ensures reliability
- **Multi-Project Support** - Handles multiple projects simultaneously with foreign session tracking
- **Security Redaction** - Automatic sanitization of API keys, passwords, and credentials

## Architecture

### System Overview

![LSL System Components](../images/lsl-components.png)

The LSL system consists of multiple layers working together to ensure reliable, real-time session logging with intelligent content classification and routing.

### 4-Layer Monitoring Architecture

The LSL system uses a **4-layer failsafe monitoring architecture** (distinct from the classification system):

**Layer 1: System-Level Watchdog** (`monitoring/global-monitor-watchdog.js`)
- Top-level supervisor monitoring all monitors
- Restarts failed monitoring processes
- Logs health status every 60 seconds

**Layer 2: Global Coordinator** (`monitoring/global-transcript-monitor-coordinator.js`)
- Manages monitoring across all projects
- Ensures exactly one monitor per project
- Coordinates monitor lifecycle and health checks

**Layer 3: Monitoring Verifier** (`monitoring/transcript-monitor-verifier.js`)
- Verifies monitor health for all active projects
- Detects suspicious activity (stuck processes)
- Health checks every 30 seconds

**Layer 4: Service-Level Self-Monitoring** (Enhanced Transcript Monitor)
- Each monitor generates `.transcript-monitor-health` file
- Real-time process metrics (memory, CPU, uptime)
- Exchange count and activity tracking

### Supervisor Priority Chain

The transcript monitor is managed by a priority-ordered chain:

| Priority | Supervisor | When Active |
|----------|-----------|-------------|
| 1 | GlobalLSLCoordinator | Session active (started by `coding`) |
| 2 | GlobalProcessSupervisor | No coordinator running |
| 3 | HealthPromptHook | GPS restart budget exhausted |

GPS defers to the coordinator via `pgrep` check, preventing dual-supervisor race conditions.

### Self-Protection

- **Periodic flush**: Writes exchanges every 5 minutes during long runs (prevents multi-hour buffering)
- **Idle timeout with tmux guard**: Before idle-exit, checks for active tmux session via pane cwd
- **Auto-recovery**: Prompt hook spawns coordinator when GPS has given up (rate-limited 1/min)

### Core Components

**Enhanced Transcript Monitor** (`scripts/enhanced-transcript-monitor.js`):
- Monitors transcript sources (Claude `.jsonl`, Copilot `events.jsonl`, OpenCode SQLite) in real-time
- Detects session boundaries and organizes into time windows
- Generates health files with process metrics
- Routes classified content to appropriate destinations

**ReliableCodingClassifier** (`src/live-logging/ReliableCodingClassifier.js`):
- 5-layer classification system (Layer 0-4)
- Determines if content is LOCAL (project-specific) or CODING (infrastructure)
- Progressive fallback from fast pattern matching to deep semantic analysis

**Security Redaction** (`src/live-logging/ConfigurableRedactor.js`):
- 13 redaction pattern types covering all common secrets
- Automatic sanitization before writing to disk
- Configurable patterns with severity levels
- <5ms overhead per exchange

**Classification Logger** (`scripts/classification-logger.js`):
- Comprehensive decision tracking across all 5 layers
- JSONL logs for programmatic analysis
- Markdown reports with clickable navigation
- Bidirectional routing (LOCAL stays local, CODING goes to coding repo)

## How It Works

### Real-Time Monitoring

Every project started via `coding` gets its own Enhanced Transcript Monitor:

1. **Exchange Detection**: Monitor detects new exchanges across all transcript sources
2. **Periodic Refresh**: Every 60s, switches to newest transcript file
3. **Health Reporting**: Generates `.transcript-monitor-health` with process metrics
4. **Suspicious Activity**: Identifies stuck processes and processing issues

### Intelligent Classification (5-Layer System)

![5-Layer Classification System](../images/lsl-5-layer-classification.png)

> **Note**: This is the **5-layer classification system** (Layers 0-4), distinct from the 4-layer **monitoring architecture**.

**Progressive Fallback Strategy**: Each layer attempts classification; if confident, decision is final. Otherwise, falls through to next layer.

![Classification Flow](../images/lsl-classification-flow.png)

**Layer 0: Session Filter** - Conversation context and bias tracking
- Maintains sliding window of recent classifications
- Calculates conversation bias (CODING vs LOCAL)
- Handles follow-up prompts ("continue", "looks good")
- Activates when: bias strength ≥ 0.65 and neutral prompt detected

**Layer 1: PathAnalyzer** - File operation pattern matching
- Analyzes file paths for direct coding infrastructure detection
- Two-step artifact checking (local → coding repo)
- Prevents false positives from ambiguous paths
- Response time: <1ms

**Layer 2: KeywordMatcher** - Fast keyword-based classification
- Intelligent keyword analysis for coding-related terms
- Immediate classification for clear coding infrastructure content
- Response time: <10ms

**Layer 3: EmbeddingClassifier** - Semantic vector similarity
- Native JavaScript embeddings (Transformers.js)
- Model: `Xenova/all-MiniLM-L6-v2` (384-dimensional)
- Qdrant vector database with HNSW indexing
- Searches against 183 indexed coding infrastructure files
- Similarity threshold: 0.65 (configurable)
- Response time: ~50ms

**Layer 4: SemanticAnalyzer** - LLM-powered deep understanding
- Direct Groq API calls (llama-3.3-70b, qwen-2.5)
- Used when embedding classification is inconclusive
- Temperature: 0.1 for consistent decisions
- Response time: <10ms with caching

**Early Exit Optimization**: Classification stops at first confident decision, minimizing cost and latency.

### Multi-Project Architecture

![Multi-Project LSL Architecture](../images/lsl-multi-project-architecture.png)

**How It Works**:

1. **Per-Project Monitors**: Each project gets its own Enhanced Transcript Monitor
2. **Global Coordination**: Coordinator ensures no duplicate monitors
3. **Watchdog Supervision**: System-level watchdog supervises all monitors
4. **Intelligent Routing**: Classification determines content destination
5. **Foreign Session Tracking**: CODING content automatically redirected to coding repo

**Example Flow**:
```
User works in curriculum-alignment →
Monitor detects CODING content →
Routes to: coding/.specstory/history/
  YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM-HHMM_<hash>_from-curriculum-alignment.md
```

### Content Routing and Storage

**LOCAL Content** (Project-Specific):
- Stored in: `project/.specstory/history/`
- Format: `YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM-HHMM_<userhash>.md`
- Classification logs: Stay in project

**CODING Content** (Infrastructure):
- Redirected to: `coding/.specstory/history/`
- Format: `YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM-HHMM_<userhash>_from-<project>.md`
- Classification logs: Copied to coding repo

**Classification Logs**:
- JSONL format: `YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM-HHMM_<userhash>.jsonl`
- Markdown reports: Separate for LOCAL and CODING decisions
- Status files: Aggregate statistics with clickable navigation

### Security Redaction

Before any content reaches storage:

1. **ConfigurableRedactor** processes all exchanges
2. **13 pattern types** detect secrets:
   - API keys and tokens
   - Passwords and credentials
   - URLs with embedded passwords
   - Email addresses
   - Corporate user IDs
3. **Matches replaced** with `<SECRET_REDACTED>`
4. **Applied in both**:
   - Live monitoring (before storage)
   - Post-session fallback (safety net)

**Example Redaction**:
```javascript
// Before redaction
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-1234567890abcdef
"openaiApiKey": "sk-abcdef1234567890"

// After redaction
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=<SECRET_REDACTED>
"openaiApiKey": "<SECRET_REDACTED>"
```

**Performance**: <5ms overhead per exchange, minimal impact on real-time processing.

## What It Monitors

### Transcript Sources

The monitor supports three transcript sources, auto-detected per project:

| Source | Format | Change Detection | Agent |
|--------|--------|-----------------|-------|
| **Claude Code** | `.jsonl` files in `~/.claude/projects/` | File size polling | Claude Code |
| **Copilot CLI** | `events.jsonl` in `~/.copilot/session-state/` | File size polling | GitHub Copilot CLI |
| **OpenCode** | SQLite database (`~/.local/share/opencode/opencode.db`) | Message count polling | OpenCode |

All sources are normalized to a common exchange format before processing, so classification, redaction, and routing work identically regardless of which agent generated the conversation.

**Common behaviors across all sources**:
- Real-time exchange detection
- Periodic refresh to newest transcript (60s)
- Session boundary detection

**Session Boundaries**:
- Time-based windows (e.g., 1800-1900)
- Automatic session detection
- Window-based file organization

### Asynchronous Write Behavior

**Important**: LSL file writes are **asynchronous and retroactive**. Understanding this behavior prevents confusion about file modification timestamps.

**How It Works**:

1. **Time-Slot Naming**: LSL files are named by their time window (e.g., `2025-12-20_1000-1100_g9b30a.md` for the 10:00-11:00 slot)

2. **Retroactive Writing**: The transcript monitor can write to a time-slot file **after that time period has ended**. This happens because:
   - Transcript processing is asynchronous - content is buffered and written in batches
   - JSONL transcript files may not be processed immediately when they're created
   - Session end triggers a final flush of all pending content to appropriate time-slot files

3. **Modification Timestamps**: A file named `1000-1100` may show a modification time of 12:36 if:
   - The session ended at 12:36 and flushed remaining buffered content
   - The transcript monitor processed queued exchanges from that period
   - Batch recovery/reprocessing was performed later

**Example Scenario**:
```
Session starts at 09:30
User works until 11:15
Session ends at 12:36

Files affected:
- 2025-12-20_0900-1000_g9b30a.md (09:30-10:00 content)
- 2025-12-20_1000-1100_g9b30a.md (10:00-11:00 content)  ← May be modified at 12:36
- 2025-12-20_1100-1200_g9b30a.md (11:00-11:15 content)

All files may show 12:36 as modification time if content was flushed at session end.
```

**Why This Design**:
- Reduces I/O overhead during active sessions (batched writes)
- Ensures no data loss at session boundaries
- Allows recovery of content from crashed monitors
- Enables retroactive reprocessing of transcripts

**Git Implications**:
- Files may appear as modified in git status even for "past" time slots
- This is expected behavior - commit normally
- The content reflects activity during that time period, regardless of when it was written to disk

### Health Metrics

**Process Monitoring**:
```json
{
  "metrics": {
    "memoryMB": 9,
    "cpuUser": 7481974,
    "uptimeSeconds": 925,
    "processId": 78406
  }
}
```

**Activity Tracking**:
```json
{
  "activity": {
    "lastExchange": "82da8b2a-6a30-45eb-b0c7-5e1e2b2d54ee",
    "exchangeCount": 10,
    "isSuspicious": false
  }
}
```

**Suspicious Activity Detection**:
- Stale monitors (no activity for extended period)
- Stuck processes (exchange count not increasing)
- High memory usage
- Processing issues

## Troubleshooting

**Monitor not starting?**
```bash
# Check if monitor is running
ps aux | grep enhanced-transcript-monitor

# Check health file
cat .health/coding-transcript-monitor-health.json

# Restart monitor via coding command
coding --restart-monitor
```

**LSL files not being generated?**

```bash
# Verify monitor is processing exchanges
tail -50 .logs/transcript-monitor-test.log

# Check if LSL files exist for today
ls -la .specstory/history/ | grep "$(date +%Y-%m-%d)"

# Recover missing LSL files from transcripts
PROJECT_PATH=/Users/q284340/Agentic/coding CODING_REPO=/Users/q284340/Agentic/coding \
  node scripts/batch-lsl-processor.js from-transcripts ~/.claude/projects/-Users-q284340-Agentic-coding
```

**Classification not working?**
```bash
# Check classification logs
ls -la .specstory/logs/classification/

# Verify configuration
cat config/live-logging-config.json | jq '.embedding_classifier'

# Test embedding generator
node src/knowledge-management/EmbeddingGenerator.js --test
```

**Foreign sessions not routing correctly?**
```bash
# Check classification status
cat .specstory/logs/classification/classification-status_<userhash>.md

# Verify CODING content in coding repo
ls -la /path/to/coding/.specstory/history/*_from-<project>.md
```

## Recovery Procedures

### Batch LSL Recovery

When LSL files are missing due to monitor issues, use the batch processor to recover from transcripts:

```bash
# Recover all LSL files from transcripts for this project
PROJECT_PATH=/path/to/project CODING_REPO=/Users/q284340/Agentic/coding \
  node /Users/q284340/Agentic/coding/scripts/batch-lsl-processor.js from-transcripts \
  ~/.claude/projects/-Users-q284340-Agentic-<project-name>

# Recover specific date range
PROJECT_PATH=/path/to/project CODING_REPO=/Users/q284340/Agentic/coding \
  node /Users/q284340/Agentic/coding/scripts/batch-lsl-processor.js retroactive 2024-12-01 2024-12-03
```

### Monitor Health Verification

The health system now includes transcript monitor health as a verification rule:

```bash
# Check monitor health via centralized health file
cat .health/coding-transcript-monitor-health.json | jq '{status, metrics, activity}'

# View in health dashboard
open http://localhost:3032
```
