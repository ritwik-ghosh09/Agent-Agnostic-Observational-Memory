# Custom Slash Commands

> **Note**: Slash commands are now part of the unified **[Skills System](skills-system.md)** that propagates skills to all agents (Claude, Copilot, OpenCode). See that page for how to add new skills.

This document describes the custom slash commands available in the coding system. These commands are installed globally in `~/.claude/commands/` and work across all projects.

## 📚 /sl - Session Log Reader

**Purpose**: Read recent session logs for continuity across work sessions

### Usage

```bash
/sl           # Read the most recent session log
/sl 3         # Read the last 3 session logs
/sl 5         # Read the last 5 session logs
```

### What It Does

The `/sl` command provides intelligent session continuity with **context-aware behavior**:

#### In Non-Coding Projects (e.g., nano-degree, curriculum-alignment)
1. **Determines current project** from directory path
2. **Finds local session logs** in current project's `.specstory/history/`
3. **Finds redirected logs** in `coding/.specstory/history/*_from-<project>.md`
4. **Presents combined summary** of both local and redirected work

#### In Coding Project
1. **Confirms coding project** from directory path
2. **Finds local coding logs** (WITHOUT `_from-` postfix)
3. **Finds ALL redirected logs** from all projects (`*_from-*.md`)
4. **Presents comprehensive summary** showing:
   - Direct coding infrastructure work
   - Cross-project work from all projects
   - Holistic view of all development activities

### Session Log Locations

**Local Project Sessions**:
```
<project>/.specstory/history/2025-10-15_0600-0700_g9b30a.md
```

**Cross-Project Sessions (redirected to coding)**:
```
coding/.specstory/history/2025-10-15_0600-0700_g9b30a_from-curriculum-alignment.md
```

### Filename Format

- **Standard**: `YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM-HHMM_<userid-hash>.md`
- **Cross-project**: `YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM-HHMM_<userid-hash>_from-<project>.md`

### Context Determination

The command uses **context-aware logic** based on current project:

**In Non-Coding Projects:**
- Reads (n) local project logs + (n) redirected logs from coding
- Example: `/sl 2` in nano-degree reads:
  - 2 newest from `nano-degree/.specstory/history/*.md`
  - 2 newest from `coding/.specstory/history/*_from-nano-degree.md`

**In Coding Project:**
- Reads (n) local coding logs + (n) redirected logs from ALL projects
- Example: `/sl 2` in coding reads:
  - 2 newest from `coding/.specstory/history/*.md` (no `_from-` postfix)
  - 2 newest from `coding/.specstory/history/*_from-nano-degree.md`
  - 2 newest from `coding/.specstory/history/*_from-curriculum-alignment.md`
  - 2 newest from `coding/.specstory/history/*_from-*.md` (any other projects)

### Example Output

#### Example 1: `/sl` in Non-Coding Project (nano-degree)

```
📋 Session Log Summary (Last Session)
══════════════════════════════════════

📁 Project: nano-degree
⏰ Local Session: 2025-10-17 14:00-15:00
🔄 Redirected Session: 2025-10-17 15:00-16:00

Local Activities:
• Course content development
• Updated learning modules
• Fixed exercise code examples

Redirected Activities (from coding):
• Developed new LSL logging system
• Fixed post-session-logger syntax error
• Updated slash command documentation

💡 Combined Context: Course work + infrastructure improvements
```

#### Example 2: `/sl 2` in Coding Project

```
📋 Session Log Summary (Last 2 Sessions)
══════════════════════════════════════

📁 Project: coding (infrastructure)
⏰ Sessions: 2025-10-17 14:00-18:00

Coding Infrastructure Work:
• Centralized health monitoring system
• Updated MCP service configuration
• Fixed transcript monitor processes

Cross-Project Work:
nano-degree (2 sessions):
  • Course module refactoring
  • Exercise solution updates

curriculum-alignment (2 sessions):
  • Dashboard UI improvements

💡 Holistic Context: Infrastructure + all project work
```

### When to Use `/sl`

- **Starting a new session** - Get context from previous work
- **After a break** - Remember what you were doing
- **Context switching** - Understand recent activities in a project
- **Cross-project work** - See how coding infrastructure work relates to projects

## 🔒 /lg - Live Guardrails

**Purpose**: Access constraint monitor dashboard and real-time compliance status

### Usage

```bash
/lg              # Show status and open dashboard (default)
/lg status       # Show detailed status only
/lg dashboard    # Open dashboard only
/lg violations   # Show recent violations
/lg help         # Show help information
```

### What It Does

The `/lg` command provides instant access to:

- **Compliance scoring** (0-100% scale)
- **Violation tracking** (real-time)
- **Risk assessment** (Low/Medium/High)

### Status Display

```bash
/lg status
```

Output:
```
🔒 Live Guardrails - System Status
═══════════════════════════════════════════════
📊 Current Status: [🔒85%] [🧠✅]

🎯 Detailed Metrics:
📊 Compliance: 85%
✅ Status: No active violations
🟢 Risk Level: Low

📈 Recent Activity:
• Last violation: 2 hours ago (no-console-log)
• Sessions monitored: 3/3 active
• Compliance trend: ↗️ Improving
```

### Dashboard Access

```bash
/lg dashboard
```

Opens web interface at `http://localhost:3001/dashboard` showing:

- **Real-time metrics**: Visual charts and graphs
- **Activity feed**: Live event logging
- **Constraint configuration**: Enable/disable rules
- **Historical analysis**: Compliance trends over time
- **Violation details**: Code snippets and fix suggestions

### Status Indicators

| Icon | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 🔒 | Constraint Monitor active |
| 🧠 | Semantic Analysis active |
| ✅ | No violations detected |
| 🟡 | Active violations present |

### Risk Levels

| Level | Icon | Score Range | Meaning |
|-------|------|-------------|---------|
| Low | 🟢 | 80% - 100% | Excellent compliance |
| Medium | 🟡 | 50% - 79% | Some violations |
| High | 🔴 | 0% - 49% | Critical issues |

### Violation Types

The Live Guardrails system monitors for:

**Critical Violations** (BLOCKING):
- Hardcoded secrets/API keys
- Dynamic code execution
- Parallel file creation (v2, enhanced, improved)
- Architectural violations

**Error Violations** (BLOCKING):
- Empty catch blocks
- Evolutionary naming patterns
- Missing error handling

**Warning Violations** (ALLOWED with feedback):
- Console.log usage
- Deprecated variable declarations
- Code style issues

### Integration with Status Line

The `/lg` command complements the status line display:

**Status Line**: `[🔒85%] [🧠✅]`
- Quick visual indicator in every message
- Compact format (drops to `[🔒75%🟡4]` when active violations are present)

**`/lg` Command**: Detailed breakdown
- Full compliance metrics
- Violation history
- Risk assessment

### When to Use `/lg`

- **Before committing code** - Check compliance score
- **After constraint violations** - See detailed feedback
- **Periodic health checks** - Monitor code quality trends
- **Reviewing violations** - Examine recent issues and fixes

---

## 🔄 Command Workflow Integration

### Session Start Workflow

```bash
# 1. Read previous session for context
/sl

# 2. Check current compliance status
/lg status

# 3. Begin work with context and quality awareness
```

### During Development

- **Status line** provides continuous monitoring: `[🔒85%]`
- **`/lg`** for detailed checks when needed
- **Constraint violations** block critical issues automatically

### Session End Workflow

```bash
# 1. Final compliance check
/lg status

# 2. Review any violations
/lg violations

# 3. Session logs automatically captured for next /sl
```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### `/sl` Not Finding Logs

**Issue**: Command reports no session logs found

**Solutions**:
1. Check if `.specstory/history/` directory exists
2. Verify session logs were created (LSL system running)
3. Check file permissions on .specstory directory

```bash
ls -la .specstory/history/
# Should show *.md files with recent timestamps
```

### `/lg` Dashboard Not Opening

**Issue**: Dashboard command fails or shows connection error

**Solutions**:
1. Verify constraint monitor is running:
   ```bash
   lsof -i :3001
   ```

2. Start the dashboard manually:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/q284340/Agentic/coding/integrations/mcp-constraint-monitor
   npm run dashboard
   ```

3. Check constraint monitor installation:
   ```bash
   ls -la /Users/q284340/Agentic/coding/integrations/mcp-constraint-monitor/
   ```

### Commands Not Available

**Issue**: Claude Code doesn't recognize `/sl` or `/lg`

**Solutions**:
1. Verify installation:
   ```bash
   ls -la ~/.claude/commands/
   ```

2. Re-run installer if needed:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/q284340/Agentic/coding
   ./install.sh
   ```

3. Restart Claude Code session
