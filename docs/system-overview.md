# System Overview

The Coding system provides a unified semantic analysis and knowledge management platform that learns from every development interaction across all AI coding assistants.

## What is Coding?

Coding is an intelligent development infrastructure that:

- **Captures** every conversation and code change across projects
- **Classifies** content to route knowledge appropriately
- **Analyzes** patterns using 14 specialized AI agents
- **Enforces** code quality through real-time constraint monitoring
- **Accumulates** knowledge that improves over time
- **Works** seamlessly with Claude Code, GitHub CoPilot, and other AI assistants

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Live Session Logging (LSL)

**Real-time conversation classification and intelligent routing**

- **4-Layer Classification**: Path analysis → Keywords → Embeddings → Semantic LLM
- **Smart Routing**: Automatically separates infrastructure work from project-specific content
- **Zero Data Loss**: Every exchange captured and properly organized
- **Multi-Project Support**: Simultaneous monitoring across multiple projects
- **Performance**: <50ms classification with 95%+ accuracy

**Learn more:** [Live Session Logging Documentation](lsl/README.md)

### 2. Constraint Monitoring

**Real-time code quality enforcement through PreToolUse hooks**

- **18 Active Constraints**: Security, architecture, code quality, documentation
- **Severity-Based Enforcement**: Critical/Error blocks, Warning/Info guides
- **PreToolUse Interception**: Blocks violations before execution
- **Dashboard Monitoring**: Live violation feed and compliance metrics
- **Testing Framework**: Automated and interactive testing with 44% detection rate

**Learn more:** [Constraint Monitoring Documentation](constraints/README.md)

### 3. Status Line System

**Visual system health and activity indicators via unified tmux status bar**

- **Tmux-Based Rendering**: All agents (Claude, CoPilot) wrapped in tmux via shared `tmux-session-wrapper.sh`
- **Real-Time Status**: Shows LSL activity and constraint compliance
- **Health Monitoring**: 4-layer monitoring with automatic recovery
- **Session Windows**: Time-based session boundaries with activity indicators
- **Activity Detection**: Distinguishes coding infrastructure vs. project work
- **Visual Feedback**: Icons show system state at a glance, tmux formatting codes (underline, bold) render correctly

**Learn more:** [Status Line Documentation](health-system/README.md)

## Integration Architecture

The system is built on **self-contained integration components**, each with its own repository and documentation:

### MCP Semantic Analysis Server

**14-agent AI analysis system for deep code understanding**

- CoordinatorAgent (orchestration)
- GitHistoryAgent, VibeHistoryAgent, SemanticAnalysisAgent (uses LLM)
- WebSearchAgent, InsightGenerationAgent (uses LLM), ObservationGenerationAgent
- QualityAssuranceAgent (uses LLM), PersistenceAgent, DeduplicationAgent

**Documentation:** [integrations/mcp-server-semantic-analysis/](../integrations/mcp-server-semantic-analysis/)

### MCP Constraint Monitor

**Real-time constraint enforcement with dashboard**

- PreToolUse hook interception
- 18 configurable constraints across 4 severity levels
- REST API (port 3031) and Next.js Dashboard (port 3030)
- Compliance scoring and violation tracking

**Documentation:** [integrations/mcp-constraint-monitor/](../integrations/mcp-constraint-monitor/)

### LLM Provider Layer (`@rapid/llm-proxy`)

**Standalone LLM abstraction with 14 providers, tier-based routing, and proxy bridge**

- **External dependency:** [`rapid-llm-proxy`](https://bmw.ghe.com/adpnext-apps/rapid-llm-proxy) — shared with OKB
- Copilot: Direct HTTP POST to Copilot API (~2s, OAuth from `auth.json`)
- Claude Code: CLI shell-out `claude -p --output-format json` (~12s)
- Cloud API fallbacks: Groq, Anthropic, OpenAI, Gemini, GitHub Models
- Local fallbacks: DMR, Ollama
- Infrastructure: circuit breaker, LRU cache, metrics, quota tracking
- Proxy bridge (port 12435) for Docker containers without host CLI access

![LLM Proxy Architecture](images/llm-cli-proxy-architecture.png)

**Why**: A single provider-agnostic LLM layer shared across projects. Subscription providers (Copilot, Claude Max) run at zero per-token cost; paid APIs serve as fallback. Copilot scales with parallelism — 0.77s effective per call at 10 concurrent requests.

**Documentation:** [rapid-llm-proxy repo](https://bmw.ghe.com/adpnext-apps/rapid-llm-proxy) · [Provider Configuration](provider-configuration.md)

### VSCode CoPilot Integration

**Enhanced GitHub CoPilot with knowledge management**

- Knowledge base access from CoPilot chat
- Command palette integration
- Seamless UKB/VKB access

**Documentation:** [integrations/vscode-km-copilot/](../integrations/vscode-km-copilot/)

---

## Knowledge Management

### Update Knowledge Base (UKB)

**Capture insights from development work**

- Interactive insight capture
- Automatic git commit analysis
- Pattern extraction from conversations
- Significance scoring (1-10)
- PlantUML diagram generation

**Usage:**
```bash
# Manual insight
ukb "Problem: X, Solution: Y, Technologies: Z"

# Auto-analyze git history
cd /path/to/project
ukb  # Analyzes recent commits
```

### Visualize Knowledge Base (VKB)

**Interactive web-based knowledge graph**

- 3D force-directed graph visualization
- Entity and relationship exploration
- Search and filtering
- Export capabilities
- Real-time updates

**Usage:**
```bash
vkb  # Opens http://localhost:8080
```

## Architecture Highlights

### 4-Layer Monitoring System

Bulletproof reliability through redundant monitoring:

1. **System-Level Watchdog** - macOS launchd, runs every 60s (ultimate failsafe)
2. **Global Service Coordinator** - Self-healing daemon with exponential backoff
3. **Monitoring Verifier** - Mandatory session-level verification (blocks Claude startup if unhealthy)
4. **Service-Level Health** - Individual service self-monitoring and auto-restart

**Learn more:** [4-Layer Monitoring Architecture](health-system/README.md#architecture)

### Classification & Routing

Intelligent content classification for proper knowledge organization:

- **Layer 0**: Session filter (detects session continuations)
- **Layer 1**: Path analyzer (file operation patterns) - <1ms
- **Layer 2**: Keyword matcher (coding-related terms) - <10ms
- **Layer 3**: Embedding classifier (vector similarity) - <50ms
- **Layer 4**: Semantic analyzer (LLM-powered) - <100ms when needed

**Learn more:** [LSL Classification System](lsl/README.md#reliablecodingclassifier)

### Storage Architecture

The coding project uses a **three-tier storage architecture** optimized for different data types:

1. **Graph Database** (Graphology + Level) - `.data/knowledge-graph/`
   - **Primary knowledge storage** for entities and relations
   - Used by both Continuous Learning (automatic) and UKB/VKB (manual)
   - Persistent local storage (binary LevelDB format)
   - Auto-persists every 5 seconds

2. **Qdrant Vector Database**
   - Semantic similarity search via embeddings
   - Written by Continuous Learning, queryable by UKB/VKB
   - 384-dim (fast) and 1536-dim (accurate) collections

3. **SQLite Analytics Database** - `.data/knowledge.db`
   - Budget tracking, session metrics, embedding cache
   - **NOT for knowledge storage** (moved to Graph DB as of 2025-10-22)

**Optional**: Manual export to `.data/knowledge-export/*.json` for git-tracked team collaboration.

## Workflow Examples

### Daily Development Workflow

```bash
# Start Claude Code with all systems
coding --project ~/Agentic/my-project

# Work on code...
# LSL automatically captures and classifies conversations
# Constraint monitor blocks quality violations

# At end of day, capture key insights
ukb  # Auto-analyzes git commits since last run

# View accumulated knowledge
vkb
```

### Cross-Project Learning

```bash
# Work on project A
cd ~/projects/auth-service
coding
# Learn patterns about authentication...

# Switch to project B
cd ~/projects/api-gateway
coding
# Knowledge from project A is available!
# Search for "authentication" in knowledge base
```

### Semantic Analysis Workflow

Within Claude Code session:
```
# Analyze codebase
determine_insights {
  "repository": ".",
  "conversationContext": "Refactoring authentication",
  "depth": 10
}

# Generate comprehensive report
execute_workflow {
  "workflow_name": "complete-analysis"
}

# Extract reusable patterns
extract_patterns {
  "source": "authentication module",
  "pattern_types": ["design", "security"]
}
```
