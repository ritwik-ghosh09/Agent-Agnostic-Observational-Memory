# UKB/VKB - Knowledge Management

Two complementary approaches for capturing and visualizing development insights.

![Knowledge Management Architecture](../images/knowledge-management-architecture.png)

## Two Systems

| System | Trigger | Purpose |
|--------|---------|---------|
| **UKB** (Update Knowledge Base) | Manual/MCP | Curated insights, team sharing |
| **Continuous Learning** | Automatic | Real-time session learning |
| **VKB** (Visualize) | `vkb` command | Web-based visualization |

!!! note "Not Parallel Systems"
    UKB and Continuous Learning serve different purposes:

    - **UKB**: Manual curation, git-tracked, team collaboration
    - **Continuous Learning**: Automatic, private, semantic retrieval

## UKB (Manual/Batch)

### What It Does

- Analyzes git commits for patterns
- Interactive structured capture
- Ontology classification (4-layer pipeline)
- Git-tracked JSON exports for team sharing

### Usage (Within Claude Code)

```
# Incremental analysis (recent changes)
"ukb"

# Full analysis (entire codebase)
"full ukb"
```

### Storage

```
.data/knowledge-graph/     # Graphology + LevelDB
.data/knowledge-export/    # Git-tracked JSON exports
  coding.json
  other-project.json
```

### Ontology Classification

13 entity types organized into a [six-facet upper ontology](ontology.md):

| Facet | Entity Types | Question Answered |
|-------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Structure** | File, Service, Feature | What it IS |
| **Behavior** | Contract | What it DOES |
| **Operations** | RuntimeDiagnostics, StaticDiagnostics, Port, Config, Container, Process | How it RUNS |
| **Resilience** | Fault, Limitation | What goes WRONG |
| **Quality** | *(properties on Structure entities)* | How GOOD it is |
| **Evolution** | Revision | How it CHANGED |

Team-specific lower ontologies extend these with project-specific types (e.g., `LSLSession`, `MCPAgent`, `GraphDatabase`).

## Continuous Learning (Automatic)

### What It Does

- Real-time extraction from LSL exchanges
- Embedding generation (384-dim or 1536-dim)
- Semantic search across sessions
- Budget-aware LLM usage (configurable monthly limit)

### Storage

```
Qdrant (Vector Database):
  knowledge_patterns (1536-dim)
  knowledge_patterns_small (384-dim)
  session_memory (384-dim)

SQLite (.cache/knowledge.db):
  budget_events
  knowledge_extractions
  embedding_cache
```

### Privacy-First

5-layer sensitivity classification routes data:

- Sensitive data goes to local models (free, private)
- Safe data goes to remote models (fast, accurate)

## VKB (Visualization)

```bash
# Start visualization server
vkb

# Opens browser to http://localhost:8080
```

### Features

- Interactive force-directed graph
- Color-coding by entity type
- Full-text search
- Filter by type, significance, source
- Entity relationship exploration

## Comparison

| Aspect | UKB | Continuous Learning |
|--------|-----|---------------------|
| Trigger | Manual MCP command | Automatic |
| Input | Git commits, prompts | LSL exchanges |
| Storage | GraphDB | Qdrant + SQLite |
| Collaboration | Git-tracked | Local only |
| Search | Name/type-based | Semantic similarity |

### When to Use UKB

- Documenting architectural decisions
- Post-sprint knowledge capture
- Creating team knowledge base
- Recording bug fix patterns

### When to Use Continuous Learning

- Automatic (always on)
- Semantic search during development
- Cross-session continuity
- Private session learning
