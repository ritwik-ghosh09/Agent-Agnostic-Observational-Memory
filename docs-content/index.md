# Coding

**A self-learning experience layer for AI coding assistants**

Coding wraps around your AI coding assistant to capture conversations, build knowledge, prevent mistakes, and track progress - creating a continuously improving development environment.

## What is Coding?

Coding is an infrastructure layer that enhances AI coding assistants by:

- **Capturing everything** - Automatic session logging of all prompts, tool calls, and responses
- **Learning from experience** - Build a knowledge base from your coding history and conversations
- **Preventing mistakes** - Constraint system stops errors before they happen

## Key Features

### Live Session Logging (LSL)

Every conversation is captured automatically with intelligent 5-layer classification that routes content between projects.

![LSL Sample Output](images/lsl-sample-output.png)

- Real-time monitoring with zero data loss
- Automatic redaction of secrets and credentials
- Multi-project support with foreign session tracking
- Configurable time-based slots (hourly files)

### Knowledge Management (UKB/VKB)

A 14-agent AI system extracts insights from your git history and conversation logs, building a searchable knowledge graph.

![VKB Viewer — interactive knowledge graph with 281 entities across Project, Component, SubComponent, and Detail hierarchy](images/viewer.png)

**Update Knowledge Base (UKB)**:
```bash
ukb           # Incremental update from last checkpoint
ukb full      # Full analysis from first commit
ukb debug     # Single-stepping with mocked LLM
```

**View Knowledge Base (VKB)**:
```bash
vkb           # Opens http://localhost:8080
```

### Constraint System

20+ configurable constraints enforce code quality via PreToolUse hooks - preventing mistakes before they happen.

![Constraint Dashboard](images/constraint-dashboard.png)

- Real-time violation detection and blocking
- Web dashboard for monitoring and configuration
- Per-project constraint configuration
- Auto-correction suggestions

---

### Health Monitoring

3-layer supervision architecture ensures system reliability with automatic recovery.

![Health Dashboard](images/health-dashboard-hero.png)

- Process health monitoring with automatic restart
- Service lifecycle management
- Multi-agent workflow visualization
- LLM call tracing (tokens, duration, costs)

---

### Status Line

Real-time feedback via the unified tmux status bar showing system health, costs, and development state. All coding agents (Claude, Copilot, OpenCode, Mastracode) are wrapped in tmux sessions with a shared status line rendered by `combined-status-line.js`.

![Coding Environment — Tmux Status Bar](images/status-line.png)

| Indicator | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| Health icons | Service status (green/red) |
| Cost display | API usage tracking |
| LSL status | Logging window and routing |

### Multi-Agent Support

While Claude Code is the primary and default agent, **coding** is fully agent-agnostic. Any coding assistant can be integrated with a single config file — no changes to shared code needed.

| Agent | Launch | Status |
|-------|--------|--------|
| **Claude Code** (default) | `coding` or `coding --claude` | Full MCP integration |
| **GitHub Copilot CLI** | `coding --copilot` | Pipe-pane I/O capture |
| **OpenCode** | `coding --opencode` | Pipe-pane I/O capture |
| **Mastracode** | `coding --mastra` | Lifecycle hook transcripts |

All agents share the same infrastructure: tmux session wrapping, status line, health monitoring, LSL session logging, knowledge management, and constraint enforcement. Missing agent CLIs are auto-installed on first launch.

## Design Principles

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Agent-Agnostic** | Designed for any AI assistant — add a new agent with [a single config file](guides/agent-integration.md). Claude, CoPilot, OpenCode, and Mastracode integrated |
| **Non-Intrusive** | Docker deployment keeps your system clean |
| **Provider Flexible** | Works with Anthropic, OpenAI, Groq, and local LLMs (DMR/llama.cpp) |
| **Multi-Project** | Handle multiple projects with automatic context routing |
| **Multi-Developer** | Session logs tagged per user for collaboration |
| **Self-Healing** | 3-layer supervision with automatic recovery |
