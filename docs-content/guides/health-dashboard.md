# Health Dashboard Deep Dive

Comprehensive health tracking and status reporting across all Claude Code sessions.

![System Health Dashboard](../images/health-monitor.png)

!!! info "Phase 33 architecture (current)"
    The architecture below describes the historical 6-layer multi-supervisor design. Phase 33 (plan 33-04) consolidated the layered system into a single **health coordinator at :3034** that owns the live state, with reporters (ETM, `health-verifier verify` CLI) writing signals and consumers (statusline, dashboard, prompt hook) reading state. See [Health Monitoring](../architecture/health-monitoring.md) for the current model. The retired daemons (`HealthVerifier` daemon mode, `StatusLineHealthMonitor`, `GlobalProcessSupervisor`, `GlobalLSLCoordinator`) and their on-disk artifacts (`.health/verification-status.json`, `.logs/statusline-health-status.txt`, `.lsl/global-registry.json`) are no longer in use.

## 6-Layer Protection Architecture (historical)

![4-Layer Monitoring Architecture](../images/4-layer-monitoring-architecture.png)

The system formerly implemented a 6-layer monitoring protection with 9 core classes:

| Layer | Class | Purpose | Status |
|-------|-------|---------|--------|
| **Layer 0** | SystemMonitorWatchdog | Ultimate failsafe - runs via cron/launchd, ensures GSC always runs | retired |
| **Layer 1** | GlobalServiceCoordinator | Self-healing daemon managing all critical services | retired (supervisord owns lifecycle) |
| **Layer 1** | GlobalLSLCoordinator | Multi-project transcript monitoring manager | retired (launcher spawns ETMs directly) |
| **Layer 2** | MonitoringVerifier | Pre-session verification (exit 0=OK, 1=FAIL, 2=WARN) | retired |
| **Layer 3** | HealthVerifier | Core verification engine with auto-healing | reduced to one-shot CLI (`verify` / `status` / `report`) |
| **Layer 4** | StatusLineHealthMonitor | Health aggregation for Claude Code status bar | retired (statusline reads coordinator directly) |
| **Layer 5** | EnhancedTranscriptMonitor | Real-time per-project transcript monitoring | active (POSTs `lsl_heartbeat` to coordinator) |
| **Layer 5** | LiveLoggingCoordinator | Logging orchestration with multi-user support | retired |
| **Core** | ProcessStateManager | Unified registry with atomic file locking | retired |

![Health System Classes](../images/health-system-classes.png)

---

## 9-Class System Design

### Core Infrastructure: ProcessStateManager

**Location:** `scripts/process-state-manager.js`

- Unified registry for all system processes (`.live-process-registry.json`)
- Atomic file operations via proper-lockfile
- Session-aware process tracking (global, per-project, per-session)
- Used by ALL other health system classes

### Layer 0: SystemMonitorWatchdog

**Location:** `scripts/system-monitor-watchdog.js`

- Ultimate failsafe "monitor monitoring the monitor"
- Runs via system cron/launchd every minute
- Ensures GlobalServiceCoordinator is always running
- Cannot be killed by user processes

### Layer 1: GlobalServiceCoordinator

**Location:** `scripts/global-service-coordinator.js`

- Self-healing service management daemon
- 15-second health checks with exponential backoff recovery
- Manages: constraint API, constraint dashboard, MCP servers
- Service registry maintenance

### Layer 1: GlobalLSLCoordinator

**Location:** `scripts/global-lsl-coordinator.js`

- Multi-project transcript monitoring manager
- 30-second health checks on all registered projects
- Auto-recovery of dead Enhanced Transcript Monitors
- Maintains: `.global-lsl-registry.json`

### Layer 2: MonitoringVerifier

**Location:** `scripts/monitoring-verifier.js`

- Pre-session verification of all monitoring systems
- Exit codes: 0=OK, 1=Critical failure (MUST NOT START), 2=Warning
- Validates: watchdog, coordinator, project registration, service health

### Layer 3: HealthVerifier (now reporter-mode CLI)

**Location:** `scripts/health-verifier.js`

Reduced to a one-shot reporter in plan 33-04. The `start` (daemon) subcommand was removed; the `[program:health-verifier]` supervisord block was retired in commit `58e968e45`. Surviving subcommands:

| Command | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| `verify` | Run database/service/process/file checks, POST a `verify_run` signal to the coordinator, exit 0/1 |
| `status` | GET coordinator `/health/state`, print compact summary |
| `report` | GET coordinator `/health/state`, print verbose (or `--json`) |

Auto-healing now flows through the coordinator (re-introduced after the initial Phase-33 cut): the dashboard's Restart-button click POSTs `coordinator :3034 /health/remediate { action, service }`, which dispatches via `HealthRemediationActions.executeAction()` on the host. The coordinator also runs an `ensureEtmForActiveProjects()` safety net every tick that auto-spawns ETM for any project with an active transcript and no fresh heartbeat. See [Auto-healing](../architecture/health-monitoring.md#auto-healing) for the full wiring.

### Layer 4: StatusLineHealthMonitor (retired)

**Replaced by** on-demand rendering in `scripts/combined-status-line.js`. The statusline pulls coordinator `/health/state` per render and synthesizes the verifier-shape fields the badge logic needs. The legacy `.logs/statusline-health-status.txt` file is no longer written or read.

### Layer 5: EnhancedTranscriptMonitor

**Location:** `scripts/enhanced-transcript-monitor.js`

- Real-time per-project transcript monitoring
- 2-second check interval for prompt detection
- Writes health files to centralized `.health/` directory
- Generates LSL files in `.specstory/history/`

### Layer 5: LiveLoggingCoordinator

**Location:** `scripts/live-logging-coordinator.js`

- Orchestrates live logging components
- Manages LSLFileManager and operational logging
- Multi-user support with user hash tracking
- Performance metrics collection

---

## Dashboard Features

The system includes a real-time web-based health dashboard accessible at `http://localhost:3032`:

### Monitoring Cards

**1. Databases** (LevelDB, Qdrant, CGR Cache)

- Real-time connection status via coordinator sub-checks (`leveldb_lock_check`, `qdrant_availability`, `graph_integrity`)
- Lock detection and ownership tracking
- Availability monitoring
- CGR Cache staleness tracking (commits behind HEAD, "up to date" when 0 behind)

**2. Services** (VKB Server, Constraint Monitor, Dashboard, Semantic Analysis)

- Port connectivity checks
- Process health validation
- Service uptime tracking

**3. Processes** (Process Registry, Stale PIDs)

- Process State Manager (PSM) status
- Stale PID detection (probes for orphaned consolidation heartbeat files)
- Automatic cleanup reporting

**4. LLM Proxy Health** (Internet, Proxy, Network Location)

- Internet reachability (from coordinator `network.internet_reachable`)
- Proxy status (from coordinator `network.proxy_running`)
- Network location: VPN / Corporate / Home (from coordinator `network.location`)
- Local proxy (px) running status
- Auto-heal status

### Dashboard Actions

- **Run Verification**: Manually trigger health verification
- **Auto-Healing**: Toggle automatic recovery mechanisms
- **Live Updates**: Real-time status updates every 5 seconds
- **Violation Tracking**: Detailed view of active system violations
- **Recommendations**: Actionable suggestions for system health improvement

### Observations and digests — cold-store rendering

Older rows that have been pruned from the live SQLite DB are served from the JSON cold tier (the same `.data/observation-export/*.json` files we commit for cross-machine sync). The dashboard tells you when this happens:

- **Snowflake icon** (sky-blue `Snowflake` from `lucide-react`) on every observation card and digest row whose `_origin === 'cold'`. Hover for the tooltip `Older than retention window — served from JSON cold store.`
- The icon appears in two places per item — once on the card header and once inline next to the timestamp — so the cue is visible whichever way the operator is scanning.
- Pagination walks across both tiers (Phase 35-07 full-union pagination). Cold rows can appear on **any** page, not just the first.

If you see a sticky `Observations API unreachable` banner *and* a row of snowflake-tagged items, the banner is left over from a single transient 502 — it now self-clears on the next successful `/api/consolidation/status` poll (which happens every 2 s while the page is open). For the architectural side of this, see [Health Monitoring — Observation cold storage](../architecture/health-monitoring.md).

## UKB Workflow Monitor

The dashboard includes a dedicated UKB Workflow Monitor that provides visual tracking of knowledge base update workflows:

![UKB Workflow Monitor](../images/health-monitor-multi-agent-wf.png)

### Features

- **Visual Multi-Agent Workflow Graph** - Hub-and-spoke visualization showing the Coordinator orchestrating 13 specialized agents (Git, Vibe, Code, Semantic, Ontology, QA, etc.)
- **Agent Status Indicators** - Real-time execution status per agent (running, completed, not yet run)
- **Pipeline Statistics** - Commits processed, sessions analyzed, candidates discovered vs. final entities
- **Deduplication Metrics** - Shows reduction percentage (e.g., 86.9% reduction from raw to final)
- **Entity Breakdown** - Final counts by type (GraphDatabase, MCPAgent, System, Pattern, etc.)
- **Execution Details** - Duration, LLM provider used (e.g., Groq llama-3.3-70b), completion status
- **Historical View** - Browse past workflow executions with full details

![Workflow Detail View](../images/health-monitor-multi-agent-wf-2.png)

### Sub-Steps Visualization

The workflow graph now displays sub-steps for multi-step agents. Click the blue badge on an agent node to expand and view its internal processing steps:

![Sub-Steps Expanded View](../images/health-monitor-multi-agent-wf-3.png)

Each sub-step arc shows the step name and can be clicked to view detailed information including inputs, outputs, and LLM usage:

![Sub-Step Details Sidebar](../images/health-monitor-multi-agent-wf-4.png)

**Sub-Steps Features:**

- **Auto-expand on running**: When a multi-step agent starts executing, its sub-steps automatically expand with animation
- **Pulsing animation**: Running agents display a pulsing glow effect on their sub-step arcs
- **Rotating indicator**: A rotating dashed circle shows active processing
- **Click to select**: Click any sub-step arc to view its detailed information in the sidebar
- **Inputs/Outputs**: Each sub-step shows what data it receives and produces
- **LLM Usage**: Indicates whether the sub-step uses no LLM, fast, standard, or premium models

### Execution Tracing

![Workflow Trace Modal](../images/health-monitor-multi-agent-wf-5.png)

The "View Trace" button opens the execution trace modal showing the complete timeline of all workflow steps with detailed timing, outputs, and any errors encountered.

**Access:** Click the "UKB Workflow Monitor" card on the dashboard or navigate to the dedicated tab.

---

## Workflow Debug Controls

The UKB Workflow Modal provides powerful debugging capabilities for development and troubleshooting:

![Workflow Debug Mode](../images/ukb-workflow-debug-mode.png)

### Single-Step Mode

Enable single-step mode to pause the workflow after each agent completes, allowing you to inspect intermediate results:

![Single-Step Sequence](../images/ukb-workflow-single-step-sequence.png)

**How to Enable:**

1. Open the UKB Workflow Monitor
2. Toggle "Single-Step Mode" checkbox before starting a workflow
3. Or start with: `ukb debug` in Claude chat

**Controls:**

| Button | Action |
|--------|--------|
| **Continue** | Execute next agent and pause |
| **Skip** | Skip current agent, move to next |
| **Run All** | Disable single-step, run to completion |
| **Abort** | Stop workflow immediately |

### LLM Mode Control

![LLM Mode Control](../images/llm-mode-control.png)

The workflow supports three LLM execution modes, configurable per-workflow or globally:

| Mode | Description | Cost | Use Case |
|------|-------------|------|----------|
| **Public** | Use configured cloud providers (Groq, Anthropic, OpenAI) | $$ | Production, high-quality analysis |
| **Local** | Use DMR/llama.cpp local models | Free | Development, privacy, offline |
| **Mock** | Return simulated responses | Free | Testing, UI development |

**Switching Modes:**

- **Per-workflow**: Toggle in the workflow modal before starting
- **Via Claude**: `ukb debug` (enables mock mode by default)
- **Environment**: Set `SEMANTIC_LLM_MODE=local|public|mock`

### Mock LLM Mode

Mock mode returns pre-defined responses without making actual LLM calls. Useful for:

- Testing workflow UI without API costs
- Debugging agent sequencing
- CI/CD pipeline testing
- Developing new agents

**Enable Mock Mode:**

```bash
# Via Claude chat
ukb debug  # Automatically enables mock mode

# Via environment
export SEMANTIC_LLM_MODE=mock
```

### Local LLM Mode (DMR/llama.cpp)

Run workflows using locally-hosted models via Docker Model Runner or llama.cpp:

**Prerequisites:**

1. DMR running on configured port (default: 12434)
2. Model downloaded and available

**Configuration:**

```env
# .env.ports
DMR_PORT=12434
DMR_HOST=localhost

# .env
LOCAL_MODEL=llama-3.2-3b  # Or your preferred model
```

**Benefits:**

- Zero API costs
- Data privacy (no external calls)
- Offline operation
- Faster iteration during development

See [LLM Providers Guide](llm-providers.md) for complete local model setup.

### Tracer View

The tracer provides detailed execution logs for every LLM call:

![Workflow Trace Modal](../images/health-monitor-multi-agent-wf-5.png)

**Tracer Information:**

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Agent** | Which agent made the call |
| **Provider** | LLM provider used (groq, local, mock) |
| **Model** | Specific model (llama-3.3-70b, etc.) |
| **Input Tokens** | Prompt token count |
| **Output Tokens** | Response token count |
| **Duration** | Call latency in milliseconds |
| **Cost** | Estimated cost (if applicable) |
| **Input** | Full prompt sent |
| **Output** | Full response received |

**Access Tracer:**

1. Click "View Trace" button in workflow modal
2. Or expand any agent node and click the trace icon
3. Filter by agent, status, or time range

### Step-Into Sub-Steps

For agents with multiple internal steps, you can step into sub-step execution:

![Sub-Step Details](../images/health-monitor-multi-agent-wf-4.png)

**Enable Sub-Step Debugging:**

1. Enable "Step Into Sub-Steps" checkbox
2. Workflow will pause at each sub-step boundary
3. Inspect inputs/outputs for each sub-step
4. Continue to next sub-step or skip to next agent

**Sub-Step Information:**

- Step name and sequence number
- Input data from previous step
- Output data produced
- LLM usage indicator (none/fast/standard/premium)
- Execution duration

## Daemon Robustness Mechanism

The HealthVerifier daemon implements a defense-in-depth approach to ensure continuous health monitoring.

### Heartbeat Mechanism

The daemon writes a heartbeat file every verification cycle to prove liveness:

**Location:** `.health/verifier-heartbeat.json`

```json
{
  "pid": 64832,
  "timestamp": "2025-12-14T07:32:42.292Z",
  "uptime": 30.98,
  "memoryUsage": 11647584,
  "cycleCount": 2
}
```

### Defense-in-Depth Summary

| Layer | Mechanism | Protection |
|-------|-----------|------------|
| Internal | Error Handlers | Catches uncaught exceptions/rejections |
| Internal | Timer Self-Check | Detects if setInterval stops |
| External | Heartbeat File | Proves daemon is alive and cycling |
| External | API Watchdog | Auto-restarts stale/dead daemons |

---

## Auto-Recovery Mechanisms

![Supervisor Restart Hierarchy](../images/supervisor-restart-hierarchy.png)

### Plug'n'Play Behavior

The system provides seamless recovery without requiring user intervention:

1. **Dead Monitor Detection**: Identifies stale or crashed monitor processes
2. **Automatic Recovery**: Spawns new monitors for unmonitored sessions
3. **Registry Updates**: Maintains accurate process tracking
4. **Health Verification**: Confirms recovery success

### Recovery Scenarios

- **Stale PID Recovery**: Detects and replaces dead process IDs
- **Missing Monitor Recovery**: Creates monitors for active but unmonitored sessions
- **Coordinator Recovery**: Restarts coordination processes when needed
- **Health Check Recovery**: Resumes health checking when coordinator fails

### Global Monitoring Enhancements

1. **Port Connectivity Monitoring**: Tests dashboard (port 3030) and API (port 3031) connectivity
2. **CPU Usage Detection**: Identifies stuck processes consuming excessive CPU (>50%)
3. **Process Health Validation**: Verifies running processes match expected PIDs
4. **Stuck Server Detection**: Automatically detects and reports unresponsive dashboard servers

---

## Database Health Monitoring

### Database Lock Detection

- **Pre-flight Lock Detection**: Checks for Level DB locks before opening database
- **Lock Owner Identification**: Uses `lsof` to identify which process holds database locks
- **Actionable Error Messages**: Provides clear instructions for resolving lock conflicts
- **Qdrant Health Checks**: Monitors vector database availability

### Health Check Response

```javascript
{
  levelDB: {
    available: boolean,
    locked: boolean,
    lockedBy: number | null  // PID of lock holder
  },
  qdrant: {
    available: boolean
  }
}
```

### Fail-Fast Architecture

The system uses explicit error handling instead of silent degradation:

**Error Message:**
```
Failed to initialize graph database: Level DB is locked by another process (PID: 12345).
This is likely the VKB server. To fix:
  1. Stop VKB server: vkb server stop
  2. Or kill the process: kill 12345
  3. Then retry your command
```

---

## Health Data Storage

### Coordinator-Centric Architecture (Phase 33+)

ETM health is no longer kept in per-project `.health/*.json` files. The
`enhanced-transcript-monitor` POSTs `lsl_heartbeat` signals to the
health-coordinator's `/health/signal` endpoint on every poll cycle,
and the coordinator's in-memory `state.lsl` slice is the sole source
of truth.

- **Endpoint**: `http://localhost:3034/health/state`
- **Slice**: `state.lsl[<sid>:<projectName>]`
- **Schema**: `{ status: 'running'|'stopped', lastBeat: <ms-epoch>, projectName, ... }`
- **Process registry**: `ProcessStateManager` (`scripts/process-state-manager.js`) tracks ETM PIDs at `'enhanced-transcript-monitor' / 'per-project' / { projectPath }`.

### Inspecting Live ETM Health

```bash
# All ETMs across all projects
curl -fs http://localhost:3034/health/state | jq '.lsl'

# Just one project (e.g. coding)
curl -fs http://localhost:3034/health/state \
  | jq '.lsl | to_entries | map(select(.key | endswith(":coding")))'

# Process registry view (PIDs)
node -e 'const PSM=require("./scripts/process-state-manager.js").default;(async()=>{const p=new PSM();await p.initialize();console.log(await p.getService("enhanced-transcript-monitor","per-project",{projectPath:process.cwd()}));})()'
```

### Coordinator State Shape

```json
{
  "etm-82997-1778496466077:coding": {
    "status": "running",
    "lastBeat": 1778497234567,
    "projectName": "coding",
    "transcriptPath": "/Users/.../coding/<session-id>.jsonl"
  }
}
```

Heartbeat staleness threshold is `HEARTBEAT_STALENESS_MS = 15_000`
(coordinator marks `status='stopped'` after 15s without a beat); stopped
entries are evicted after `EVICT_AFTER_STOPPED_MS = 5 * 60 * 1000`.

### Legacy `.health/` Directory

The `.health/` directory still exists but only holds the slimmer
`*-transcript-monitor-state.json` files (per-ETM crash-recovery state),
NOT the `*-transcript-monitor-health.json` files documented in earlier
versions. The old health-JSON shape was retired at the Phase 33
cutover (commit `8f304038e` and the coordinator-signal migration that
followed). Plan 34-05 Task 2(d) removed the last reader sites in
`scripts/combined-status-line.js` on 2026-05-11.

---

## PSM Singleton Pattern

The StatusLine Health Monitor daemon implements a robust singleton pattern via PSM integration:

### Registration Flow

1. On startup, daemon checks PSM for existing healthy instance
2. If found and `--force` not specified, exits with error message
3. If not found or `--force` specified, registers as global service
4. Refreshes health check timestamp every 30 seconds
5. On graceful shutdown, unregisters from PSM

### CLI Options

```bash
# Start daemon (will fail if already running)
node scripts/statusline-health-monitor.js --daemon

# Force start (kills existing instance)
node scripts/statusline-health-monitor.js --daemon --force

# With auto-healing enabled
node scripts/statusline-health-monitor.js --daemon --auto-heal
```

### Viewing PSM Status

```bash
node scripts/process-state-manager.js status
```

Output:
```
Process Health Status:
   Total: 5 | Healthy: 5 | Unhealthy: 0

Global Services:
   global-service-coordinator (PID: 13296, uptime: 9492m)
   global-lsl-coordinator (PID: 13816, uptime: 9491m)
   vkb-server (PID: 6074, uptime: 858m)
   statusline-health-monitor (PID: 39770, uptime: 1m)

Project Services:
   /Users/q284340/Agentic/coding:
     enhanced-transcript-monitor (PID: 40417, uptime: 0m)
```

## Performance Metrics

### Resource Usage

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Memory per Monitor | ~5-15MB |
| CPU Usage | <1% per monitor during normal operation |
| Disk I/O | Minimal (health file updates every 15 seconds) |
| Network | None (local file system only) |

### Scalability

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Supported Sessions | Unlimited (tested with 10+ concurrent sessions) |
| Discovery Time | <100ms for session discovery |
| Recovery Time | <5 seconds for auto-recovery |
| StatusLine Update | Real-time (sub-second updates) |

---

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Level DB is locked by another process"**

```bash
# Check what's holding the lock
lsof .data/knowledge-graph/LOCK

# Stop VKB server
vkb server stop

# Or kill the process
kill <PID>
```

**Sessions Not Appearing in StatusLine**

1. Check Global LSL Registry: Verify project is registered
2. Check Claude Transcript Directory: Ensure session has active transcript
3. Verify Monitor Process: Check if transcript monitor is running

**Auto-Recovery Not Working**

1. Check Coordinator PID: Verify coordinator process is current
2. Check Health Check Interval: Ensure health checks are running
3. Manual Recovery: `node scripts/global-lsl-coordinator.js health-check`

### Health Check Commands

```bash
# Verify all components are working
node scripts/statusline-health-monitor.js --verify

# Test session discovery
node scripts/statusline-health-monitor.js --discover

# Check auto-recovery status
node scripts/global-lsl-coordinator.js status

# Check all process health
ps aux | grep -E "(transcript-monitor|global-lsl-coordinator)"
```
